        <p>If the population of data becomes very large, it is difficult to obtain 
           the characteristic values such as the mean or variance. In this case, 
           estimating the characteristic of the population by taking an appropriate 
           number of samples from them is called a statistical estimation. 
        <p>Making rational decision in uncertain situation using this estimate is 
           an important function of modern statistics.

  <div class="mainTable">
      <p>
         The quality test for smartphones which may cause a defective or breakage 
         in products cannot be conducted on all products. Therefore, a method of 
         selecting and investigating some of the products produced is usually chosen.
      <p>
         The entire data subject to a statistical survey are called the <b>population</b>,
         and some of the population selected for the survey are called <b>samples</b>. 
         In general, the population is very large. 
      <p>
         In order to find out the characteristic of the population such as the mean,
         if you survey the entire population, it is called the <b>total survey</b>. 
         However, a total survey of all populations requires enormous costs and time. 
         In addition, a total survey is not appropriate if the product can be destroyed 
         during the inspection such as the impact quality test.
      <p>
         When such a total survey is difficult, the <b>sample survey</b> that investigates 
         some samples from the population is used. Estimating the characteristic 
         of the population using samples selected from the population is called 
         the <b>inferential statistics</b>.

  <p>
  <div class="mainTable">
      <p>
         When we estimate the characteristic of the population using samples, the result
         may vary depending on how samples are selected, so many studies have been 
         conducted on the sampling method. In general, the most commonly used method
         for sampling is the <b>simple random sampling</b> that ensures that each element
         in the population has the same probability of being selected. Drawing lots
         which is often used among friends is an example of a simple random sampling method. 
  </div>
  <p>
  <div class="mainTableYellow">
      <p><b><span style="font-size:1.5em">‚ú®</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Simple random sampling</b>

         Each element in the population has the same probability of being selected.	
  </div>
  <p>
  <div class="mainTable">
      <p>
         When samples are selected from a population, there are two types of methods 
         such that one is '<b>with replacement</b>' and the other is 
         '<b>without replacement</b>'.  After a sample is selected, it is included 
         in the population again in case of  'with replacement' method. The selected 
         sample is not included in the population in case of 'without replacement'. 
      <p>
         In general, random numbers are used a lot to ensure that each element in 
         the population has the same probability of being selected. Random numbers
         are numbers that are scattered from 0 to 9 without any particular regularity 
         or bias. [Table 4.1] is a part of the random number table which arranges
         these random numbers into rows and columns.

         <img class="imgFig600600" src="./Figure/Table0401.png">
      <p>
         For example, there are 50 students in a class and their identification numbers
         are 1, 2, ... and 50. In order to select three students of them randomly, 
         first select any one row and one column. If the row 3 and column 11 are selected, 
         read down the double digits starting from here which gives 19, 94, 21, and 28. 
         Among them, numbers outside of 1 to 50 are discarded and three students whose 
         numbers are 19, 21, and 28 are selected.

    <div class="mainTablePink">
        <h5>‚è± Practice 4.2</h5>
              Seven students from our school created a hobby club and suppose each student

         Simple random sampling using a random number table as shown above is not easy 
         to apply when the sample size is large. Recently random numbers generated 
         by computer using a uniform distribution are commonly used. &lt;Figure 4.1&gt;
         shows 10 random numbers selected from 1 to 100 numbers without replacement

         distribution \([a,b]\) with replacement, real-type Uniform  distribution \([a,b]\),
         normal distribution \(N(\mu, \sigma^2 )\), and two-dimensional normal distribution

         In order to take three samples out of 50 students, first make a list of students
         and then assign identification numbers such as from 1 to 50. In order to select 
         three students, select the first option which is the integer uniform distribution
         without replacement in 'Random Number Generator' of „ÄéeStatH„Äè, Enter (1, 50), 
         enter 3 for 'Number of Data n =' and click [Execute] button, then three random

         The purpose of statistical experiments or surveys is to find out the characteristics
         of the population. The characteristics of the population such as the mean, variance,
         and standard deviation are called the <b>population mean, population variance and 
         population standard deviation</b> denoted by \(\mu, \sigma^2, \sigma\) respectively.
      <p>
         When \(n\) samples are randomly selected from a population, their mean, variance, 
         and standard deviation are called as the <b>sample mean, sample variance, and 
         sample standard deviation</b> denoted by \(\overline X , S^2 , S\) respectively. 
         If \(X_1 , X_2 , ... , X_n \) represent random variables of samples, 
         \(\overline X , S^2 \) and \(S\) are defined as follows: 
      <p>
      <div class="textLeft">
         \(\overline X = \frac{1}{n}(X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n)\)

      <p>
         In the definition of the sample variance \(S^2\), division by \(n-1\) is to 
         estimate the population variance accurately, but its detail explanation can 
         be done in university level of statistics.
      <p>
         The actual observed values of the random variable \(X_1 , X_2 , ... , X_n \)
         are denoted as \(x_1 , x_2 , ... , x_n \) and their sample mean, sample variance
         and sample standard deviation are as follows:

         For example, when three samples are taken from the first-year high school
         male population, the possible number of three samples is countless, 
         so this is indicated as random variables \(X_1 , X_2 , X_3 \). If the actual
         heights of the three selected students are 160cm, 170cm, and 180cm, these are 
         denoted as \(x_1 = 160, x_2 = 170, x_3 = 180\) and their sample mean, sample 
         variance and sample standard deviations are as follows:
      <p>
      <div class="textLeft">

         of a standard normal distribution using „ÄéeStatH„Äè. Looking at the figure, 
         it can be seen that the minimum (min) and maximum (max) of the population

         Looking at the figure, as the sample size increases, the distribution of the

  <div class="mainTable">
      <p>
         When a sample survey is conducted, only one set of samples is taken from the population to estimate the population mean. In general, we think the mean of the samples as an estimate of the population mean, but can the sample mean obtained from one set of samples among countless possible set of samples predict the population mean well? 
      <p>
         The sampling distribution of all possible sample means studied in the previous section is 
         the answer to this question. That is, no matter what a population distribution is, 
         if the sample size is large enough, all possible sample means become dense with a normal 
         distribution shape around the population mean. Therefore, the mean of a set of samples 
         we obtained is usually close to the population mean, and even in the worst case, 
         the difference from the population mean (referred to as an error) is not large, 
         so the sample mean can be said to be a good estimate of the population mean. 
         The larger the sample size, the more dense the distribution of the sample means is, near the population mean, so this error decreases.
      <p>
         The fact that one value of the observed sample mean is an estimate of the 
         population mean is called the <b>point estimation</b> of the population mean 
         (meaning that it is estimated as one number). The sample mean used to estimate
         the population mean has several good characteristics. One characteristic examined
         in the previous section is that the mean of all possible sample means becomes 
         to the population mean, and this characteristic is called the <b>unbiased estimate</b>. 
      <p>
         Unlike the point estimation, estimating the population mean as an interval 
         is called the <b>interval estimation</b>. If the population is a normal 
         distribution with mean \(\mu\), variance \(\sigma^2\), the distribution of
         the sample mean \(\overline X\) is the  normal distribution with mean \(\mu\)
         and variance \(\frac{\sigma^2}{n}\), so the probability that one sample mean 
         will be included in the interval \(\mu ¬± 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\) is 95% as follows: 
      $$
          P ( \mu - 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \le \overline X \le \mu + 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} ) = 0.95
      $$
      <p>This equation can also be written as follows: 
      $$
          P ( \overline X - 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \le \mu \le \overline X + 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} ) = 0.95
      $$
      <p>
         The meaning of this equation is that 95% of all possible intervals obtained 
         by applying the following interval formula (assuming that \(\sigma\) is known) 
         to all possible sample means include the population mean \(\mu\). The 
         following interval formula is called the <b>95% confidence interval of 
         the population mean</b>.
      $$
          [ \overline X - 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} , \overline X + 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} ]
      $$
      <p>In general, since \( \overline X ‚âà N(\mu , \frac{\sigma^2}{n} )\), the
         standardized random variable of \(\overline X\), that is  
         \( Z = \frac{\overline X - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt n}} \) follows \( N(0,1) \). 
         Therefore we can write the following probability statement. 
      $$
          P ( - z_{\alpha / 2} \le \frac{ \overline X - \mu} {\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} \le z_{\alpha /2} ) = 1- \alpha
      $$
      <p>The left hand side of the aboe equation can also be written as follows: 
      $$
          P ( \mu - z_{\alpha /2 } \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \le \overline X \le \mu + z_{\alpha /2 } \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} ) = 1- \alpha
      $$
      <p>(1-\(\alpha\)) is called the <b>confidence level</b>, that refers to the 
         probability of intervals in which the population mean is included among all
         intervals calculated by this interval formula. Usually, 0.01 or 0.05 is used
         for \(\alpha\). \(z_{\alpha}\) implies a value with a probability  at the right end 
         of the standard normal distribution. In other words, if \(Z\) is a random 
         variable that follows the standard normal distribution, the probability 
         that \(Z\) is greater than \(z_{\alpha}\) is \(\alpha\), and if expressed 
         by an equation, \(P(Z \ge z_{\alpha} ) = \alpha \) is established. For example,
         \(z_{0.025}\) = 1.96, \(z_{0.005}\) = 2.575, etc. Therefore, the 99% confidence
         interval formula of the population mean is as follows:
      $$
          [ \overline X - 2.575 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} , \overline X + 2.575 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} ]
      $$
      <p>
         &lt;Figure 4.7&gt; shows 95% confidence intervals for the population mean 
         by randomly selecting 100 sets of samples with the sample size \(n = 20\) 
         from 10,000 population data which follow the standard normal distribution. 
         In this case, only 94 out of 100 confidence intervals contain the population
         mean of 0. Whenever these experiments are repeated, results can vary slightly. 
         This simulation shows that, when estimating the confidence interval of the 
         population mean several times, the confidence interval by using the above 
         formula includes the population mean approximately to the confidence level.

      <p><h4>üé≤ Example 4.5</h4>
         The height of all first-year high school male students follows the normal distribution with the population standard deviation of 10cm. Ten high school first-year male students were randomly selected and their heights were investigated as follows:
      <p>
      <div class="textLeft">   171, 172, 185, 169, 175, 177, 174, 179, 168, 173
      </div>
      <p>
         Using „ÄéeStatH„Äè, answer the followings about the mean height of male students in the first grade of high school. 
      <p>
         1) Find the 95% confidence interval.<br>
         2) Find the 99% confidence interval.<br>
         3) Compare the above two confidence intervals.
      <h5>Solution</h5>
      <p>
              If there are data of samples, it is easy to estimate the population mean 
              by using „ÄéeStatH„Äè. Select 'Population Mean Confidence Interval'  from 
              „ÄéeStatH„Äè menu, enter the data as shown in &lt;Figure 4.8&gt;, and click 
              [Execute] button to calculate the 95% confidence interval.
      <p>
               If you select the 99% confidence level and click [Execute], the 99% confidence interval is calculated.
      <p>
               Under the interval graph, there is a simulation window that can adjusts the sample  size and confidence level.
