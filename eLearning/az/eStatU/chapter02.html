  <h3>CHAPTER OBJECTIVES</h3> 
      In this chapter, we introduce graphs to visualize qualitative data such as bar graph, pie chart, 
         band graph, and line graph in Section 2.1. 
      In Section 2.2, we discuss visualization of summary data of single categorical variable using  『eStat』. Visualization of summary data of a categorical variable by a group is also discussed.
      In Section 2.3, we discuss visualization of raw data of a categorical variable using  『eStat』. Visualization of raw data of a categorical variable by a group is also discussed.

      Data of gender for students in a classroom, which are either a male or a female, are referred to as qualitative data. 
      Data of marital status for employees in a company, which are either single or married, are also qualitative data. 
      Bar graph, pie chart, band graph, and line graph are used to visualize the qualitative data. These graphs are 
      frequently used as an exploratory data analysis of the qualitative data. 
      <p>
      <img class="imgIcon" src="http://www.estat.me/assets/icon/eStat_icon09_bar.png"> <br>
      A bar chart (or bar graph) is a graph that presents the qualitative data with rectangular bars in a way that their heights (or lengths) are proportional to frequencies of their categories. Therefore, the frequencies of all categories in a categorical variable can be easily compared by watching the heights (or lengths) of the rectangular bars. We usually put some space between the rectangular bars to emphasize that they represent the distinct categories of a variable. 
      <p>The rectangular bars of the bar chart can be plotted either vertically or horizontally. One axis of the chart shows all categories of a variable, and the other axis represents the frequencies of each category. If the frequency of each category is represented as a vertical height of a bar drawn up and down in the bar graph, it is called a vertical bar graph. A bar can also be drawn left and right whose length is proportional to the frequency of each category and it is called a horizontal bar graph. 
      <p>
      <img class="imgIcon" src="http://www.estat.me/assets/icon/eStat_icon35_VbarSeparated.png"> 
      <img class="imgIcon" src="http://www.estat.me/assets/icon/eStat_icon36_VbarStacked.png"> 
      <img class="imgIcon" src="http://www.estat.me/assets/icon/eStat_icon37_VbarRatio.png"> 
      <img class="imgIcon" src="http://www.estat.me/assets/icon/eStat_icon38_VbarSide.png"> 
      <img class="imgIcon" src="http://www.estat.me/assets/icon/eStat_icon39_VbarBilateral.png">
      <br>
      A bar graph can be drawn after counting frequencies of all categories of a variable. If there is another categorical variable, frequencies of all categories of the first categorical variable can be counted for each category of the second categorical variable. For example, we can count the number of single and married employees for both a male and a female category. We can draw two bar graphs of the marital status for both the male and the female categories so that both graphs have the same scale of Y-axis to compare the frequencies of the male category with the frequencies of the female category easily. This graph is called a separated bar graph of the marital status by gender variable. In this case, the gender variable is called a group variable and the marital status is called an analysis variable. 
      <p>If a variable is analysed by using a group variable, there are many variants of bar graphs which compare visually well all categories of the group variable. A stacked bar graph divides a single bar, which represents the frequency of a category of the analysis variable, into pieces with different colors which are proportional to the frequency of each category of the group variable. A ratio bar graph draws that all bars (rectangles) of each category of the analysis variable have the same height and divides each bar into pieces with different colors which are proportional to the frequencies of each category of the group variable. A side by side bar graph is that in each category of the analysis variable rectangular bars of all categories of the group variable are drawn side by side ways for comparison using the same scale. If there are only two categories of the group variable, a two-sided bar graph (or a bi-lateral bar graph) can be used which draws bars of one category of the group variable 
        in one side and bars of the other category of the group variable in the opposite direction. The direction can be either the left and right side of the Y-axis or the above and below of the X-axis.
      <p>

      <img class="imgIcon" src="http://www.estat.me/assets/icon/eStat_icon45_Doughnut.png">
      <br>
      A pie chart is a graph that shows frequencies of all categories of the analysis variable by dividing a pie (circle) into pieces with different colors depending on angle which is proportional to the frequency of each category. We usually draw the largest piece of category in a clockwise order starting from 12 oclock so that the ratio can be compared well.
      <p>A doughnut chart which removes a center circle of the pie chart can also be used.
      <p>
      <img class="imgIcon" src="http://www.estat.me/assets/icon/eStat_icon11_band.png">
      <br>
      A band graph is similar to the ratio bar graph that shows frequencies of all categories of the analysis variable by dividing a rectangle into square pieces with different colors which are proportional to frequencies of all categories. It is also similar to the pie chart. The square pieces can be sorted in descending order by the frequencies of each category, but 『eStat』 draw the square pieces in the order of category values of a categorical variable. 
      <p>
      <img class="imgIcon" src="http://www.estat.me/assets/icon/eStat_icon12_line.png">
      <br>
      A line graph shows frequencies (or values) of all categories of an analysis variable in a two-dimensional graph. The X-axis shows names of categories and the Y-axis represents the scale of frequencies (or values) of all categories. Each pair of the values, the category name and its frequency, is marked as a point in a two-dimensional coordinate plane and two adjacent points are connected with a line. The line graph may be similar to the vertical bar graph which connects only top centers of each bar. The line graph is usually used to visualize time dependent data to watch its trend over time. For example, the yearly amount of export in a country can be visualized using the line graph.

      In this section visualization of summary data without a group variable and visualization of summary data with a group variable are discussed.
  <p>
  <h4>2.2.1 Summary Data of Categorical Variable</h4>
  <p>

    <div class="mainTable">
      <p>If you investigated a gender of students in a class and reported the result as follows.
      <p>
      <p class="textLeft">'male', 'female', 'male', ‘female’, 'male'. 'male', .'male', ‘female’, ‘female’, 'male'... 
      <p>
      <p>This data is called the raw data of the gender variable which is a categorical variable.
      <p>If you counted the number of ‘male’ students and ‘female’ students in the above raw data and reported the result as shown in Table 2.2.1. 
      <p class="textLeft">Table 2.2.1 Summary data of the gender in a class</p>
      <table style="width:600px"> 
        <tr> 
          <th class="thGrey">Gender</th>
          <th class="thGrey">Students</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="tdCenter">Male</td>
          <td class="tdCenter">6</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="tdCenter">Female</td>
          <td class="tdCenter">4</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>This data is called the summary data of the gender variable.
      <p>If the number of data increases, counting the number of cases in each category from the raw data 
         of a categorical variable in order to make the summary data is not an easy task. One of the important 
         functions of a statistical package is to organize the raw data into the summary data by counting the number of cases 
         in each category. Because of difficulty of generating the summary data from the raw data, 
         governmental institutions usually provide statistics of a census to the public 
         in the form of the summary data such as the number of population by gender or 
         the number of population by region. These summary data can be downloaded from the governmental home page as an Excel file. 
      <p>An Excel file can be saved as a text file in CSV (comma separated value) format (refer &lt;Figure A.2.6&gt; in Appendix A) which can be loaded by 『eStat』 for data processing and analysis (refer Appendix A). 
      <p>This section discusses visualization of the summary data of a categorical variable which can also be found in textbooks of an elementary, a middle school, a high school and in governmental publications. 
    </div>
    <p>
    <div class="mainTableGrey">
      <b>Example 2.2.1</b><b>(Gender Summary Data)</b> 
      <p>Enter the summary data of Table 2.2.1 to the sheet of 『eStat』 and save it as a file in CSV format. Using this data, draw a bar graph, a pie chart and a band graph with 『eStat』. Analyze the graphs and prepare a report using the MS Word (or any word processor you prefer). 
      <p>
      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
        Enter the data of Table 2.2.1 to the sheet of 『eStat』 as in &lt;Figure 2.2.1&gt; and enter a variable name of V1 as ‘Gender’ and of V2 as ‘Number’ using [Edit Var] button located above the sheet (refer Appedix A.2).
      <p>
        <img class="imgFig300200" src="./Figure/Fig020201.png">
        <div class="figText">&lt;Figure 2.2.1&gt; Data input in 『eStat』 </div>
      <p>Click the first variable name 'Gender' and then the second variable name 'Number'. 
         Selected variables will be appeared in the box of the 'Selected Var' located above the sheet. 
         You can select the variable ‘1: Gender’ using the combo box of the 'Analysis Var' 
         and the variable ‘2: Number’ using the combo box of the 'By Group' located above the sheet as shown in &lt;Figure 2.2.1&gt;.
      <p>
         When variables are selected, a vertical bar graph which is the default graph of 『eStat』 is drawn as in &lt;Figure 2.2.2&gt;. 
         The height of each bar (rectangle) is proportional to the frequency of each category in the gender variable and therefore the frequencies of both the male and the female categories can be easily compared by watching the heights of bars. The bar graph shows that the number of male students is larger than the number of female students. 
      <p>A vertical bar graph which draws bars up and down as in &lt;Figure 2.2.2&gt; is widely used, 
         but a horizontal bar graph which draws bars from left to right is often used if there are many categories. 
         By clicking on the horizontal bar graph icon  located above the Graph Area, a horizontal bar graph 
         as in &lt;Figure 2.2.3&gt; will be appeared in the Graph Area. By checking the ‘Frequency’ box located below the graph,
         the frequency of each bar. will be displayed.

      International institutions such as UN, OECD and EU release their statistics to the public in the form of summary data and this data can be downloaded as an Excel file or a text file in CSV format. The following example shows how to download a file from the OECD and how to draw graphs using this file.
    </div>
    <p>
    <div class="mainTableGrey">
      <b>Example 2.2.2</b><b>(Life Expectancy at Birth : Source OECD)</b>
      <p>From the home page of the OECD, https://www.oecd.org, download a data file of the life expectancy at birth. 
        Copy the columns of the country name and 2017 data located at the last column to 『eStat』 system and save it as a file in CSV format. 
        Using this data, draw a vertical bar graph and a horizontal bar graph in descending order of the life expectancy. Analyze the graphs.
      <p>
      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
        The main screen of the OECD website as of December 2020, https://www.oecd.org, looks like as in &lt;Figure 2.2.9&gt;.
      <p>
        <img class="imgFig600400" src="./Figure/Fig020209.png">
        <div class="figText">&lt;Figure 2.2.9&gt; OECD home page</div>
      <p>
        Select the menu Topics &gt; Health, then the screen as in &lt;Figure 2.2.10&gt; will be appeared. 
      <p>
        <img class="imgFig600400" src="./Figure/Fig020210.png">
        <div class="figText">&lt;Figure 2.2.10&gt; OECD ‘Topic’ &gt; ‘Health’ menu</div>
      <p>
      If you click on ‘Explore all our data on health’, the screen as in &lt;Figure 2.2.11&gt; will be appeared. 
      <p>
        <img class="imgFig600300" src="./Figure/Fig020211.png">
        <div class="figText">&lt;Figure 2.2.11&gt; OECD Statistics for life expectancy at birth</div>
      <p>
        If you click on ‘&gt; OECD Health Statistics 2020: Frequently Requested Data’, an Excel file of 
        OECD-Health-Statistics-2020-Frequently-Requested-Data.xls is downloaded. If you open the Excel file, 
        the menu as in &lt;Figure 2.2.12&gt; is appeared. 
      <p>
        <img class="imgFig600400" src="./Figure/Fig020212.png">
        <div class="figText">&lt;Figure 2.2.12&gt; OECD Statistics for life expectancy at birth</div>
      <p>
        If you click on ‘Life expectancy at birth, total population’ in Health status (Mortality), an Excel file as in &lt;Figure 2.2.13&gt; will be appeared on the screen. 
      <p>
        <img class="imgFig600400" src="./Figure/Fig020213.png">
        <div class="figText">&lt;Figure 2.2.13&gt; OECD Statistics for life expectancy at birth</div>
      <p>
        The easiest way to make a file in CSV format is to copy the country name to the first column of the sheet of 『eStat』 and the column of 2017 data located at the last column of this Excel file to the second column of the sheet of 『eStat』 as in &lt;Figure 2.2.14&gt;. After you provide variable names ‘Country’ and ‘Years’ by using [Edit Var] of 『eStat』 , save the data as a file, for example, ‘EX020202_OECD_LifeExpectancy.csv’ in CSV format,.
      <p>
        <img class="imgFig300400" src="./Figure/Fig020214.png">
        <div class="figText">&lt;Figure 2.2.14&gt; OECD life expectancy at birth in 2017</div>
      <p>
        Another way is to edit the Excel file in &lt;Figure 2.2.13&gt; with only two columns, the country name and 2017 data similar to &lt;Figure 2.2.14&gt;, and save it as a file in CSV format. In this case, the first row should have variable names such as ‘Country’ and ‘Number’ (refer Appendix A.2).. In order to save this file in CSV format, select the Excel menu ‘File’ &gt; ‘Save As’, then a dialogue box as in &lt;Figure 2.2.15&gt; will be appeared. Select the option ‘CSV Utf-8’, then the file will be saved in CSV format in the download folder of your computer. Note that, if you are using an European version of Excel, you have to change the delimiter of semicolon ‘;’ with comma ‘,’ before you save the file (refer Excel option). 
      <p>
        <img class="imgFig300200" src="./Figure/Fig020215.png">
        <div class="figText">&lt;Figure 2.2.15&gt; OECD</div>
      <p>
        Click the variable names ‘Country’ and ‘Number’ on the sheet of 『eStat』 , then a vertical bar graph of the life expectancy will be appeared as in &lt;Figure 2.2.16&gt;. If the characters of the country name are too small to see, you can enlarge the screen by holding the [Ctrl] key and rolling up the wheel mouse. You can click on the horizontal bar graph icon  located above the Graph Area to draw a horizontal bar graph as in &lt;Figure 2.2.17&gt;.
      <p>
        It is sometimes convenient to compare data using a horizontal bar graph after sorting. If you check a sorting option ‘Descending’ located below the graph, a horizontal bar graph sorted by descending order of the life expectancy at the birth will be appeared as in &lt;Figure 2.2.17&gt;. It is easy to check that Japan is the longest life expectancy, Switzerland is the second and Latvia is the shortest.

  <p>
  <div class="mainTable">
      The summary data as in Table 2.2.1 can be easily extended if you survey the gender of two classes in a school as in Table 2.2.2. It is the summary data of the gender variable for two classes (groups), classes of 5-1 and 5-2. In this case, we usually want to compare the summary data between two classes (groups) using graphs as the following example.

The X-axis includes values of a time variable which are spaced equally and Y-axis represents a scale of all time series data. Each pair of data, time and value is marked as a point in a two-dimensional coordinate plane and two adjacent points are connected with a line.

      Section 2.2 describes how to visualize the summary data of a categorical variable. This section describes how to visualize qualitative data in the form of raw data. In general, the raw data are processed by counting the number of data in each category of a categorical variable using a statistical package and the resulted summary data are visualized as in Section 2.2. 『eStat』 system enables this kind of work easily.

      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
      Enter the gender data of Table 2.3.1 on the sheet of 『eStat』 system or load the file from  [Ex] ⇨ eBook ⇨ EX020301_Raw_Gender.csv. 
      <p>
      If you enter the data, give a variable name 'Gender' using [Edit Var] button as shown in &lt;Figure 2.3.1&gt; and provide value labels to values 1 and 2 (1 for Male and 2 for Female). 
      If the data are edited using the value labels, it must be saved with JSON format file (click on the JSON Save icon) to ensure that the edited information is not lost.

Typical examples of the big data include data from Google's search records, social media messages by mobile phones, web logs by internet connections, and telephone records of global telecom companies. The big data are expected to grow and increase exponentially in the future and the hyper-forecasting is also expected to be possible. The success or failure of each individual, group, company and even country would depend on how to utilize the big data efficiently.
            <p>The analysis of the big data that emerged this century is so enormous and diverse in the amount of data that can not be fully utilized just by traditional statistical approaches. For the analysis and utilization of the big data, theories of statistics, computer science, mathematics, management or related disciplines must also be applied simultaneously. Data Science is a new area of study in which statistics, mathematics, computer science and other disciplines are fused to analyze and utilize the big data that emerged this century.

            <b>(Inaugural Address of US President: Jonh F. Kennedy))</b>

                  In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from this responsibility--I welcome it. I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it--and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.
                  <br>And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you--ask what you can do for your country.
                  <br>My fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.
