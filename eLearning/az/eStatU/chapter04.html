  <h3>CHAPTER OBJECTIVES</h3> 
      Chapter 2 and 3 discussed how to visualize both the qualitative data and the quantitative data using graphs. Visualizing data using graphs makes easy and fast to see any information that is nested in data. However, if you want more detailed information, it is better to summarize data by using tables or measures. <br>
      In section 4.1, we introduce a frequency table as a summary of single variable. 
      In section 4.2, we introduce a contingency table as a summary of two variables. 
      In section 4.3, we introduce measures to summarize the quantitative data and a box plot.

      A frequency table of qualitative data summarizes frequencies of each possible value of a categorical variable. A frequency table is the most commonly used tool to summarize qualitative data. The frequency table also shows relative frequencies (percents) which are calculated by dividing the frequency of each category with the number of observations belong to the category, and cumulative relative frequencies accumulated in the order of the categories. The bar graph, the pie chart and the band graph in Chapter 2 are drawn by using this frequency table of qualitative data.
      The frequency table is usually used to summarize qualitative data, but it can also be used to summarize quantitative data by transforming it to qualitative data. All possible values of the quantitative data are divided into several intervals which are not overlapped with each other and the number of observations belong to each interval is counted to make a frequency table.

  <h4>4.1.2 Frequency Table for Quantitative Variable</h4> 
  <p>
  <div class="mainTable">
      The quantitative data can have too many possible values and a frequency table of the quantitative data may not be easy to analyze. 
      In order to make a frequency table for quantitative data which can be analyzed easily, possible values of the data are divided into several intervals and frequencies of each interval are investigated. Generally, the intervals are not overlapped with each other and the number of data in each interval is counted. For this purpose, the maximum and the minimum of data are first investigated to calculate the range of the data and then determine the number of intervals. The number of intervals is typically between 5 and 10, but it may depend on a researcher’s choice. Some researchers prefer to use the square root of the number of observations. If the number of intervals is determined, the range of data (maximum - maximum) is divided by the number of intervals to calculate the width of the interval. Starting and ending points of each interval are usually described as ‘from greater than or equal (≥) \(a\)'to less than (&lt;) \(b\) ’ which means a one-sided closed interval [\(a\) ,\(b\) ).

      A contingency table or cross table is used to summarize two categorical variables and is also used to study an association of two variables. A cross table divides a table into rows and columns to create cells by using possible values of two categorical variables, and then counts the number of observations (frequency) belonging to the corresponding cell. Percentage of each cell for the sum of rows, or percentage of each cell for the sum of columns can be shown in a contingency table for further analysis. Percentage of each cell for the total number of data can also be shown in a cross table.  
      <p>A contingency table is usually made for two qualitative data. In case of two quantitative data, the quantitative data can be transformed into qualitative data by using intervals, and then a contingency table for these qualitative data can be created.

  </h6>
  <p>
  <div class="mainTable">
      The quantitative data can be summarized by using measures of central tendancy in section 4.3.1 and measures of dispersion in 4.3.2.
  </div>
  <p>
  <h4>4.3.1 Measures of Central Tendency </h4>
  <p>

    <div class="mainTable">
        Average, median and mode are the most frequently used measures of central tendency to summarize the quantitative data. 
      <p>
        A <b>mean or average</b> is the sum of all data values divided by the number of data. 
        If data \(x_1 ,x_2 ,\cdots, x_N\) are from a population, the mean of this data is referred to as a population mean and is usually denoted as \(\mu\) in Greek letter. The calculation formula can be defined as follows.
      $$
        \small \mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N x_i 
      $$
      If data \(x_1 ,x_2 ,\cdots,x_n\) are sampled from a population, the mean of this data is referred as a sample mean and denoted as \(\small \overline x\)  (read as 'x bar'). then the mean \(\small \overline x\) is defined as follows.
      $$
        \small \overline x = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i 
      $$
      Note that both the population mean and sample mean have the same formula except notation. 
      Also, note that the mean is heavily influenced by an extreme point where one data value is 
      far, very large or small, from data cluster. 
      <p>
        The sample mean can be understood as the center of gravity representing sample data. 
        Therefore, the sum of deviations which subtracts the sample mean from each of the sample data is zero as follows.
      $$
        \small \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \overline x ) = 0 
      $$
      <p>
        The sample mean has many good characteristics (Chapter 6) and is frequently used to estimate the population mean. 
      <p>
        A <b>median</b> is the value placed in the middle when data are listed in ascending order of their values and is denoted as \(M\) if data are from a population or \(m\) if data are sampled from a population. 
        If the number of sample data, \(n\), is an odd number, the median is the data value located at the \({\left( n+1 \above 1pt 2 \right)}^\text{th}\) when data are arranged in ascending order. 
        If \(n\) is an even number, then the median is the average of the data values located at the \({\left( n \above 1pt 2 \right)}^\text{th}\) and \({\left( n+2 \above 1pt 2 \right)}^\text{th}\). 
      <p>
      $$
        \begin{align}
        m &= \left( \frac{n+1}{2}\right)^\text{th} \text{ data } & \text{if $n$ is odd}\\
          &= \frac{ (\frac{n}{2})^\text{th} + \left(\frac{n+2}{2} \right)^\text{th} \text{ data }}{2} & \text{if $n$ is even}
        \end{align}
      $$
      <p>
        The median is not sensitive even if there is an extreme point in data, so it is often used as a measure of the central tendency when there is an extreme point.
      <p>
      A <b>mode</b> is the most frequently occurred value among data values.
      $$
        \small \textit{Mode} = \text{the most frequently occurred value among data values}
      $$
      In case of the quantitative data, since there might be so many possible values, it is not reasonable to set a mode value as the most frequently occurred data value. In this case, we usually transform the quantitative data into the qualitative data by dividing the data values into several not-overlapped intervals and count frequencies of each interval. The middle value of an interval which has the highest frequency is set to the mode.

        <b>Median</b> is the value placed in the middle when data are listed in ascending order of their values. The population median is usually denoted as \(M\) and the sample median is denoted as \(m\).

      <p>
        The sample mean is calculated as follows.
      <p>
        \( \qquad \small \overline x ~=~  { {5 + 6 + 3 + 7 + 9 + 4 + 8} \over 7} ~=~ 6 \)

        <div class="textLeft"> 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 </div>
      <p>
        Since the sample size, 7, is an odd number, median is \(\small {\left( 7+1 \over 2 \right)}^{th} ~=~4^{th}\) data in the arranged data as above which is 6.

    <div class="mainTable">
      There are several variants to compensate the disadvantage of the mean, one of which is a trimmed mean. This is to list the data in order and then average the data except for a constant number of large and small values respectively in order to eliminate the extremes. The trimmed mean is often used to prevent biased judging by referees in sports such as gymnastics and figure skating at the Olympics. You may remove the top few percent data instead of the maximum and the bottom few percent data instead of the minimum.
      <p>
      Another variant is a weighted mean in which each measurement is multiplied by a constant weight to obtain the mean. The grade point average for college students which uses the weights of credit hours is an example of the weighted mean. The price index which uses the weights of the total amount of sales of the goods is another example of the weighted mean.
      If \( x_{1} ,x_{2}, \dots , x_{n} \) are the data values and their weights are \( w_{1} , w_{2} ,\dots , w_{n} \), then the weighted mean is defined as the following. 
      \[
        \text{Weighted Mean} ~=~ { {w_{1} x_{1} +w_{2} x_{2} + \cdots + w_{n} x_{n}} \over {w_{1} + w_{2} + \cdots + w_{n}} } ~=~ { {\sum _{i=1} ^{n} w_{i} x_{i}} \over {\sum _{i=1} ^{n} w_{i}} }

        Find the mean and median of this data. Also, find the trimmed mean which excludes the minimum and the maximum. Compare both results. 
      <p>
      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
        This data is not a sample but a population of eight. The mean is as follows.
      <p>
        \( \qquad \small \mu ~=~ (9.0 + 9.5 + 9.3 + 7.2 + 10.0 + 9.1 + 9.4 + 9.0) / 8 ~=~ 72.5 / 8 ~=~ 9.063 \)
      <p>
        Since the number of data is \( \small N\) = 8 which is an even number, the median is the average of the 4th and the 5th data in the ordered list as follows:

        The trimmed mean is the average of the remaining numbers, except the minimum of 7.2 and the maximum of 10.0.

      In a gymnastics competition, four judges scored 3, 4, 6, and 7 points for a player A and 2, 4, 6, 
      and 8 points for a player B. Both players have the same mean of 5, but it is easy to see that 
      the player B has a large deviation in the scores compared to the player A. Degree of data dispersion 
      is calculated using a numerical value to compare two sets of data and it is called a measure of dispersion.
      The most commonly used measure of dispersion is a variance (or standard deviation) and other measures 
      include a mean absolute deviation, a range, and an inter-quartile range.
      <p>
      A variance is an average of all squared distances from each data to the mean. Therefore, if data are 
      spread widely around their mean, the variance will be large, and if data are concentrated around 
      the mean, the variance will be small. A population variance is denoted as \(\sigma^2\), and a 
      sample variance is denoted as \(s^2\). Formulas to calculate the population variance and the sample 
      variance are slightly different as follows.
      $$\small 
        \begin{align}
          &\text{Population variance} &\quad \sigma^{2} ~&=~ { {1 \over N} {\sum _{i=1} ^{N} (x_{i} - \mu )^{2}}  } ~~~~	(N:~number~ of~ population~ data)  \\
          &\text{Sample variance} &\quad s^{2} ~&=~ { { 1 \over {n-1} }{\sum _{i=1} ^{n} (x_{i} - {\overline x } )  ^{2}}  } ~~~~    	(n:~ number~ of~ sample~ data)	
        \end{align}
      $$
      There are important reasons for using \(n-1\) instead of \(n\) when calculating the sample variance 
      which will be discussed in Chapter 6. Meaning of the population variance, which is an average of all 
      squared distances from each data to the population mean, is illustrated in &lt;Figure 4.3.6&gt;. 
      In this Figure, dot mark represents each data value. \(\sigma^2\) = 2.5 is calculated as the sum of 
      squared distances (10) divided by the number of data, \(n\) = 4 in this example.

      A standard deviation is defined as the square root of the variance. A population standard deviation 
      is denoted as \(\sigma\), and a sample standard deviation is denoted as \(\s\). The variance is not 
      easy to interpret, because it is an average of the squared distances. However, since the standard

      <b>Example 4.3.6</b> <b>(Sales data)</b> <br>
         In a company, the average weekly sales was 1.36 billion dollar and its standard deviation was 0.28 billion dollar. If the same data were made in monthly sales, the average was 5.44 billion dollar and its standard deviation was 0.5 billion dollar. Calculate a coefficient of variation for each case and compare.
      <p>
      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
      The coefficient of variation in weekly sales is as follows.
      <p>
        \( \qquad \small
          \frac{0.28}{1.36} \times 100  ~=~ 20.6\%,

        \( \qquad \small

      <p>
        Therefore, we can see that the variation in monthly sales is smaller than the variation in weekly sales.

      A range is the difference between the maximum and the minimum value of data. The range is easy to calculate, but it is not a good measure of dispersion if there are extreme points.
      $$ 
        \text{Range = Maximum - Minimum}
      $$
      A \(p\)-percentile implies roughly the  percent data when data are arranged in ascending order from small to large. 
      $$ 
        p\text{-percentile} = p\%~ \text{of observations} \le \text{to this value and} ~(100-p)\% ~\ge~ \text{this value.}
      $$
      <p>
        Note that, if data size is small, a single observation may fall into several percentiles according to this definition.
      <p>
        An inter-quartile range is a measure to complement the disadvantage of the range. The 25 percentile of the data is called the 1st quartile (Q1), the 50 percentile is called the 2nd quartile (Q2) or median, and the 75 percentile is called the 3rd quartile (Q3). The inter-quartile range (IQR) is the range between the 3rd quartile and the 1st quartile.
      $$
        \text{Inter-quartile range  (IQR)  = Q3 - Q1 }
      $$
      <p>One simple way to calculate Q1 and Q3 is that, after we arrange the data in ascending order, we divide the data into two pieces which have equal number of data. In case of odd number of data, we include the median to each piece of data. Q1 is the median of the 1st piece of data and Q3 is the median of the 2nd piece of data.

      <p>
      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
         The maximum of the data is 9 and the minimum is 3, therefore range is as follows.
      <p>
        \( \qquad \small
           \text{Range} ~=~ 9 – 3 ~=~ 6.

      <p>
        <div class="textLeft"> 3, 5, 7, 9 </div>
      <p>
        The median of these numbers is the average of \( ({4 \over 2})^\text{th} \)  and \( ({4 \over 2 + 1})^\text{th} \) data.
      <p>
        \( \qquad \small
           \text{Median} ~=~ \frac{(5 + 7)}{2} ~=~ 6. 
        \)
      <p>
        In order to calculate quartiles, since the number of data is even, we divide data into two pieces as follows:

        <div class="textLeft"> 3, 5 </div>
        <div class="textLeft"> 7, 9 </div>  
      <p>
        The first quartile Q1 is the median of {3, 5} which is Q1 = 4. The third quartile Q3 is the median of {7. 9} which is Q3 = 8. So, the inter-quartile range IQR is as follows.

        The maximum of the data is 9 and the minimum is 3. Therefore, the range is as follows.

      <p>
        The median of the data is the data value of \( ({{7+1} \over 2})^\text{th} ~=~4^\text{th} \) which is 6. 
      <p>
        In order to calculate the quartiles, since the number of data is odd, divide the data into two pieces as follows. Note that the median is included in both pieces of data.

        <div class="textLeft"> 6, 7, 8, 9 </div>  
      <p>
        The first quartile Q1 is the median of {3, 4, 5, 6} which is Q1 = 4.5. The third quartile Q3 is the median of [6, 7. 8, 9] which is Q3 = 7.5.
        So, the inter-quartile range IQR is as follows.

         A box plot is a graph to show the minimum, the 1st quartile, the median, the 3rd quartile, and the maximum of the data simultaneously that has been used recently. 
         The box plot first marks the 1st quartile (Q1) and the 3rd quartile (Q3) at a horizontal line and connects with a square box. Then displays the median (Q2) at the location proportional to Q1 and Q3 in the box and connects the box with the minimum and the maximum. 
         Also, draw a vertical line at  (minimum - 1.5 IQR) and at (maximum + 1.5 IQR) as in &lt;Figure 4.3.3&gt;. Using the box plot, you can check a symmetry of data, a central location of data (median), and a degree of dispersion (IQR). 
         Data which are less than the line (minimum - 1.5 IQR) or greater than (maximum + 1.5 IQR) are considered as extremes (marked * in &lt;Figure 4.3.7&gt;). 
         Some statistical packages display the left line which is to check an extreme point as Max(minimum, Q1 - 1.5 IQR) and the right line as Min( maximum, Q3 + 1.5 IQR).
