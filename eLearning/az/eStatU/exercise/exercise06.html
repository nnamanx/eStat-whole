    <p class="textL30M30"> 6.20 In order to know the average strength of a plastic product produced by a company, how many experiments do you need to do to have the maximum allowable error bound within 20 (unit: psi) with a 99% confidence level? Previous experience suggests that the estimate for \(\sigma^2\) is 4900.

    <p class="textL30M30"> 6.21 A company with 2,500 workers wants to estimate the average time it takes to commute. The surveyor wants to estimate that the maximum allowable error bound is less than 5 minutes at the 95% confidence level. If the estimate of the population variance obtained from the preliminary study was \(\sigma^2\) = 25, what size of the sample should be extracted?

    <p class="textL30M30"> 6.22 The average IQ of an employee at a company is estimated to be within 5 points of the maximum allowable error bound at a 95% confidence level. Past experience shows that the IQ of this group follows a normal distribution with a variance of 100. How many samples should be taken?

    <p class="textL30M30"> 6.23 When a university opens a lecture Saturday, it tries to estimate the percentage of students enrolled in the class as a 95 percent confidence interval. How many students should be surveyed to keep the maximum allowable error bound within 0.05?

    <p class="textL30M30"> 6.24 Of all manufacturers, we would like to know the percentage of companies that require a doctor's diagnosis from workers when they are absent due to illness for more than three days. How many samples do you need to estimate the maximum allowable error bound within 0.05% at the 95% confidence level? 

    <p class="textL30M30"> 6.25 I want to know what percentage of households in a region where at least one member of the family sees advertisements in newspapers. I want the maximum allowable error bound is 0.04 at the 95% confidence level. When a preliminary survey of 20 households found that at least 35 percent of the responding households saw an advertisement, what should the number of sample households be?

    <p class="textL30M30"> 6.26 The consumer research group believes that TV tube life is normally distributed with two years of standard deviation. How many TV sets should be tested with 95% confidence level if the maximum allowable error bound is two years?  How many TV sets should be tested with 95% confidence level if the maximum allowable error bound is one year?

    <p class="textL30M30"> 6.27 If you want to reduce the length of the confidence interval by half, should you double the size of the sample? Explain.

    <p class="textL30M30"> 6.28 A school district had 100 samples by simple random sampling of the 5th grade elementary school students and took a math test with the sample mean of 74.3 and the sample standard deviation of 9.2.

    <div class="textL50M30">
      1) Find a 99% confidence interval in the average score of all fifth graders in this school district when they take the test.
    </div>
    <div class="textL50M30">
      2) If this sample mean 74.3 is used as an estimate of the population mean of the math test for all fifth graders in this school district, what is the maximum size of the error bound at the 95% confidence level?
    </div>
    <p class="textL30M30"> 6.29 The average weight of 50 cans of peaches which are collected by simple random sampling is 16.1 grams and their standard deviation is 0.4 grams. If the sample mean of 16.1 grams is used as an estimate of the population mean weight of all peach cans, what is the probability that the estimated error bound is less than 0.1 grams?
