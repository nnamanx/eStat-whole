        7.27 The standard deviation of the resistance of a wire made by a factory is known to be 0.02 ohms. 
           An electronics company has decided not to buy the wire if there is sufficient evidence that the 
           average resistance of the wire is greater than 0.4 ohms. The company's management adheres to the policy 
           of the significance level &alpha; = 0.05 and the sample size \(n\) = 100 in statistical tests.
