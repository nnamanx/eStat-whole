      8.7  An industrial psychologist thinks that the big factor that workers change jobs is self-esteem to workers' individual work. The scholar thinks that workers who change jobs frequently (group A) have lower self-esteem than those who do not (group B). The following data are used to measure the score of self-esteem by sampling each group independently.

      8.9  An oil company has developed a gasoline additive that will improve the fuel mileage of gasoline. We used 16 pairs of cars to compare the fuel mileage to see if it actually improved. Each pair of cars has the same details as its structure, model, engine size, and other relationship characteristics. When driving the test course using gasoline, one of the pair selected randomly and added additives, the other of the pair was driving the same course using gasoline without additives. The following table shows the km per liter for each of pairs. Is this data a basis for saying that additives increase fuel mileage? Assume that the fuel mileage is normally distributed. Use 5% significance level.

      8.17 A labor union of a company found that 63 percent of 150 salespeople who did not receive a college education wanted to take it back even now. The company did a similar study 10 years ago, when only 58 percent of 160 people wanted it. Test the null hypothesis that the desire for college education is not different from 10 years ago using the significance level of 0.05. Samples were selected independently.

      8.18 When we extracted 200 companies of the type A and examined them, we found that 12% of them spent more than 1% of their total sales on advertising. The other 200 companies of the type B independently selected and examined, we found 15% of them spent more than 1% of their total sales on advertising. Test the following hypothesis with the significance level of 0.05.
      $$ \small
        H_0 : p_B \le p_A , H_1 : p_B \gt p_A 
      $$

      8.19 In a company, a study was conducted on the leisure activities of sales staffs and managing staffs. 400 persons were selected independently from each of sales and managing staffs. 288 sales and 260 managing staffs answered that they usually spend their leisure time on sports activities. From this data, can you say that the percentage of two groups for the leisure time spent on sports activities is the same? Use the significance level of 0.05.

      8.20 In September 2013, a research institute surveyed 260 men and 263 women about a political issue and 
           the response result is as follows. Do you think there are significant differences in their way of thinking 
           on the political issue?' Specify the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis and test at the 5% 
           significance level.

      8.21 In order to see whether the unemployment rate in two cities are different, samples of 500 
           people were randomly selected from two cities and found unemployed people were 35 and 25  
           respectively. Can you say that the unemployment rate in two cities is different? 
           Describe the necessary assumptions and calculate the \(p\)-value.
