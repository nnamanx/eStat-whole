      <p>If your smart phone can read the QR code as in &lt;Figure A.1.2&gt;, you can see the same screen of 『eStat』 as &lt;Figure A.1.1&gt; on your smartphone. 
      <p>
      <p> You can also enter the address at http://www.estat.me on your smartphone web browser, preferably Chrome. Although data input using the sheet of『eStat』on your smartphone is not convenient because of its small screen, you can use all other modules as your personal computer. A lecture video to introduce 『eStat』which explains this Appendix is located at the following address or you can enter using the QR code as in &lt;Figure A.1.3&gt;.

      <p>At the top of 『eStat』 main screen, several icons (buttons) are arranged. There is also a combo box to select a language and radio buttons to select a level. These icons are the main menu of 『eStat』 system which is a different design as in many other softwares which use a foldable drop-down menu. We believe that the icon menu of 『eStat』 makes users comfortable to see what they can do using 『eStat』 at a glance. 
      <p>However, modules for the high school level and the university level have a variety of submenus separately. If you click on icons 『eStatH』  and『eStatU』 . you can see the detailed menu of『eStatH』as in &lt;Figure A.1.4&gt; and『eStatU』as in &lt;Figure A.1.5&gt; at a new window.

The center of the main screen is the Graph Area which shows the graph of a data analysis. There are also several smaller icons for changing a graph into other type.

      <h4>A.2 Data Input / Save / Open</h4>
      <b>Entering data in  『eStat』</b>
      <p>
      <p>You can enter data on the sheet of the main screen. Each row of the sheet which is numbered as 1, 2, ... , represents an observation, and each column which is denoted as V1, V2, ... , represents a variable of the observation. If you click on the row 1 and the column V1 using the mouse, the row number and the column number for this cell are displayed in dark grey color unlike other cell, and the cell has a rectangular contour with blue color as in &lt;Figure A.2.1&gt; which is called a cursor. This means that the cell where the cursor is located is ready to accept data which is a similar function to the Excel. The cursor can move from one cell to another cell using the arrow keys &larr; &rarr; &uarr; &darr; or one page to another page using the PageUp and PageDown key.   
      <p>
      <img class="imgFig300200" src="../en/Figure//Fig00A21.png">
      <div class="figText">&lt;Figure A.2.1&gt; Data input sheet</div>
      <p>
      <p>Since  『eStat』 is a web based software for educational purpose, the maximum number of rows is limited to 9,999 observations and the maximum number of columns is limited to 20 variables. You can enter data from the first row of the upper left cell (observation number 1, variable V1) and then use the down arrow key &darr; (or &crarr; key) to move the cursor to the cell below (row 2, column V1) to enter the following data. In the same way, all data can be entered into each cell while moving the cursor using the arrow keys (&larr;, &rarr;, &uarr;, &darr;). 
      <p>&lt;Figure A.2.2&gt; shows an example of data input for the number of male students and female students at two classes (named ‘5-1’ and ‘5-2’) in an elementary school. In each cell, you can enter data either characters or numbers, but we assume that all data in a single column should be the same regardless of being character data or numeric data. Mixture of characters and numbers in a cell is considered as the character data and real number which has decimal digits after dot(‘.’) is considered as the numeric data.
      <p>
      <img class="imgFig15060" src="../en/Figure//Fig00A22.png">
      <div class="figText">&lt;Figure A.2.2&gt; Example of data input</div>
      <p>
      <p>Bar graph, pie chart, and band graph can be drawn by using both the character data and the numeric data. However, dot graph, histogram, stem and leaf plot for quantitative data must use the numeric data. The character data can be used as a group variable for the graphs of quantitative data..
      <p>In &lt;Figure A.2.2&gt;, all data are visible on the sheet appeared on the main screen. If data are large and only some part of the data appeared on the sheet, you can use the PageUp and PageDown key to move up and down by page, or can move the end of left / right / up / down of the data by pressing both the Ctrl key and arrow keys (&larr;, &rarr;, &uarr;, &darr;).
      <p>

      <b>Enter the variable name and the value label of a variable</b>
      <p>
      <p>If data are entered into 『eStat』 without assigning the variable name and if they are processed for a statistical analysis, the result of the analysis will have a variable name such as V1 (implies the Variable 1), V2 (implies the Variable 2) and so on. It would be better for users to see the result with the name of the variable similar to their actual name and also the value label of the variable.  
      <p>
      <p> Click [Edit Var] button located above of the sheet. If you see the dialogue box as In &lt;Figure A.2.3&gt;, enter 'Gender' instead of 'V1' to the box of ‘Variable Name’. Select 'V2' at the combo box, then enter the class name '5-1'. Similarly, select ‘V3’, then enter '5-2'. It is recommended to limit the number of characters for a variable name or a value label up to 8 characters if possible.

      <div class="figText">&lt;Figure A.2.3&gt; Dialog box to edit variable</div>
      <p>
      <p>After the variable names are entered, click [Save] button and [Exit]. The data will have the variable names as In &lt;Figure A.2.4&gt;.
      <p>
      <img class="imgFig15060" src="../en/Figure//Fig00A24.png">
      <div class="figText">&lt;Figure A.2.4&gt; Data with the variable names</div>
      <p>
      <p>For raw data, you can specify the value labels of a variable using the same dialog box of [Edit Var] button as in &lt;Figure A.2.3&gt;. But, the maximum number of the value labels is limited up to 9 labels.
      <p>

      <b>Modifying data</b>
      <p>
      <p>If you want to modify the data entered in a cell, you can place the cursor in the desired cell to modify and enter new data. If you want to modify only a part of the data entered in a cell, you can modify it by clicking the desired cell twice and by moving the pointer to the desired position using the arrow keys (&larr;, &rarr;).

      <b>Save data</b>
      <p>
      <p>Since the data input of 『eStat』 utilizes the main memory of a computer, if power is lost, all data you entered will be lost. Therefore, once you entered all data, you must save it on a secondary memory device, such as a hard disk or an USB. 
      <p>In order to save the data you entered, enter a file name at the box of ‘File’ as in &lt;Figure A.2.5&gt;. Then click the ‘CSV Save’ icon  to save the data including the variable name. The data file is saved at the ‘download’ folder of your computer as a text file in CSV (comma separated value) format and the file name will have a csv extension automatically. For example, if you saved your data with a file name ‘021Summary_StudentByGender.csv’ as in &lt;Figure A.2.5&gt;, then you can see your saved file using the Notepad as in &lt;Figure A.2.6&gt;. It shows the separation of each data using comma (‘,’) and the first row consists of the variable names separated by comma. The text file in ‘CSV’ format can be loaded to the Excel and other softwares.

      <p>Data as in&lt;Figure A.2.5&gt; are referred to as the summary data of a categorical variable. If you click on the variable names 'Gender', '5-1' and '5-2' sequentially in  the Sheet as in &lt;Figure A.2.5&gt;, you will see the selected variable names 'V1 V2 V3' at the box of ‘Selected Var’. Then a vertical bar graph (), which is the default graph of  『eStat』 , will be appeared on the Graph Area as in &lt;Figure A.3.1&gt;. Instead of mouse clicking on the variable names, you can select the ‘Gender’ variable at the combo box of the ‘Analysis Var’ which is located above the sheet and select the variable names, '5-1' and '5-2', at the combo box of 'By Group'. You can see the same graph on your smartphone if it can recognize the QR code at the right hand side of &lt;Figure A.3.1&gt;.
