         Tossing a coin, inspecting a product, and similar things are often repeated 
         around us. We know that the possible consequences of these things are either
         'head' or 'tail', 'good' or 'defective', but we don't know what the outcome
          will be. An experiment or observation in which similar things are repeated 
          and all possible outcomes are known, but one outcome is determined by chance
         is called the <b>trial</b>.
      <p>
         The set of all possible outcomes that can occur in a trial is called the 
         <b>sample space</b>, and a subset of this sample space is called the 
         <b>event</b>. An event made up of one element is called the <b>basic event</b>.
      <p>
         The sample space is usually denoted by \(S\), and events are denoted by 
         uppercase English letters, \(A, B, C, ...\), etc. For example, in a coin 
         tossing  trial, when 'head' is H and 'tail' is T, the sample space is as follows:
      <p>
      <div class="textLeft"> \(S\) = {H, T}
      </div>
      <p>
         Events of 'head' and 'tail' are denoted as follows:

  <h4>A. Statistical Probability</h4>

      <h4>‚≠ê Think</h4>
          <b>If you toss a coin, the likelihood of getting head (H) or tail (T) seems to be half and half. Probability is a numerical representation of this likelihood. Is it correct to define the probability of getting head as a half?
          </b>
      <h4>üíé Explore</h4>
          <b>Let's toss a coin 10, 50, or 100 times to find the number of heads and check their relative frequencies of head whether it is a half or not.</b>
  </div>
  <p>
  <div class="mainTable">
      <p>An example of finding the relative frequency by actually tossing a coin 10, 50, or 100 times and writing down the number of heads is as follows:
      <table class="tableCenter"> 
        <tr>
          <th style="width:200px">Number of tosses (\(n\))</td>
          <td class="tdCenter" style="width:100px">10</td>
          <td class="tdCenter" style="width:100px">50</td>
          <td class="tdCenter" style="width:100px">100</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th class="tdCenter">Number of heads (\(x\))</td>
          <td class="tdCenter">4</td>
          <td class="tdCenter">23</td>
          <td class="tdCenter">51</td>

          <td class="tdCenter">0.51</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
         When the number of tosses is small, the relative frequency of the number
         of heads may not be 0.5. However, as the number of tosses of a coin increases,
         the relative frequency approaches 0.5. If you experiment more with the number
         of tossing a coin using a computer, it can be seen that the relative frequency
         gradually approaches 0.5 as shown in &lt;Figure 2.4&gt;. This relative 
         frequency is called the <b>statistical probability</b> of an event that
         a coin comes up head.

      <p>It is not easy to define the probabilities of all events using statistical probabilities and use them for decision-making in reality. In order to apply the probability easily to the real problem, a mathematical probability based on the model was studied.

          <b>A dice is made in the shape of a cube, with one to six dots drawn on each side. </b>
      <h4>üíé Explore</h4>
          <b>Since a dice was made in the shape of a cube, the probability of each side when the dice was rolled would be equal to 1/6. There are many games that use this dice, but are these games fair?</b>
  </div>
  <p>
  <div class="mainTable">
      <p>
         In order to obtain the statistical probability of each side of the dice, 
         numerous trials of rolling the dice are required. The statistical probability
         obtained through sufficient trials will be close to 1/6. However, it is not easy
         in reality to do many trials to find the probability of one event.
      <p>
         If one dice is rolled, the sample space is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Assume that 
         each element in the sample space has the same likelihood of occurrence. 
         The probability of each element can be said to be 1/6. A mathematical probability
         is defined as the likelihood of an event under the rational assumption that 
         each element in the sample space is equally likely to appear. When making 
         decisions about real problems, this mathematical probability is used a lot.
      <p>
         In general, assuming that each element of the sample space \(S\) in a trial 
         has the same probability of occurrence, the mathematical probability that
         an event \(A\) will occur denoted as \(P(A)\)  is defined as follows:
      <p>
      <div class="textLeft">
         \(P(A) = \frac{n(A)}{n(S)}\) <br>
         \(n(S)\) is the number of elements in the sample space<br>
         \(n(A)\) is the number of elements in event \(A\)
      </div>

        An office worker went on a business trip to a city, and there were two restaurants 
        (Restaurant 1 and Restaurant 2) near his accommodation. He hesitated about which restaurant 
        to go. He rolled a dice and counted the number of dots that appear on the top. If an odd number came up, he decided to go to Restaurant 1, and if it was even, he decided to go to Restaurant 2. What is the probability that Restaurant 1 would be chosen?
      <h5>Solution</h5>
        The sample space of rolling a dice trial which counts the number of dots 
        appearing on the top is \(S\) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The event of odd numbers is
        \(A\)  = {1, 3, 5}. The number of elements in the sample space is \(n(S)\) = 6 
        and the number of elements in the event \(A\) is \(n(A)\) = 3. Therefore, 
        the probability of Restaurant 1 being selected is as follows: 
      <p>
      <div class="textLeft">

         the event of remaining numbers 3, 4, 5, 6 is called the <b>complementary event</b>

      <h5>Solution</h5>
         The probability that one defective product was found in 3 product inspections

         1) If you randomly select one of the high school students, the probability of being a male student is as follows:
      <div class="textLeft">
         \( P(A) = \frac{n(A)}{n(S)}  = \frac{24}{40}\)

         2) If you randomly select a student, the probability that this student is a male student and wears glasses is as follows:
      <div class="textLeft">
         \( P(A \cap B ) = \frac{n(A \cap B)}{n(S)} = \frac{8}{40} \) 
      </div>
      <p>
         3) When one of the male students is randomly selected, the probability that 
            this student wears glasses is denoted as a symbol \(P(B|A)\), and, 
            since the event of a male student \(M\) can be viewed as a sample space,
            it is calculated as follows:

         \( P(B|A) = \frac{n(A \cap B)}{n(A)}  = \frac{8}{24} \) 
      </div>
      <p>
         \(P(B|A)\) is called the <b>conditional probability</b> of wearing glasses (\(B\))
         when a male student is selected (\(A\)).
      <p>
         If \(S\) is a sample space of a statistical experiment, the conditional 
         probability of the event \(B\) when the event \(A\) occured is as follows:

      <div class="textLeft">
         \( P(B|A) = \frac{n(A \cap B)}{n(A)} \) 
      </div>
      <p>
         If we divide both numerator and denominator by \(n(S)\), the conditional 
         probability becomes as follows: 
      <p>
      <div class="textLeft">
         \( P(B|A) = \frac{\frac{n(A \cap B)}{n(S)}}{\frac{n(A)}{n(S)}} = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)} \)

         Here, the probability of all students wearing glasses 
         \(P(B) = \frac{20}{40} = \frac{1}{2}\) is the same as that of male students 
         \( P(B|A) = \frac{12}{24} = \frac{1}{2} \). 
         If the occurrence of an event \(A\) does not affect the probability that 
        the event \(B\) will occur, that is, 
      <p>
      <div class="textLeft">
         \( P(B|A) = P(B)\) 
      </div>
      <p>
         it is said that two events \(A\) and \(B\) are <b>independent</b> of each other.
         On the other hand, if two events \(A\) and \(B\) are not independent, it is said 
         two events are dependent.
      <p>
         If two events \(A\) and \(B\) are independent, the rule of multiplication 
         becomes as follows:
      <p>
      <div class="textLeft">
         \( P(A \cap B) = P(A) √ó P(B|A) = P(A) √ó P(B) \) 
      </div>
      <p>
         Inversely, if  \( P(A \cap B) = P(A) √ó P(B) \) and \(P(A) \ne 0\), the conditional probability becomes as follows: 
      <p>
      <div class="textLeft">
