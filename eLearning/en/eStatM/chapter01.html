          <b>The height of 10 students in our class was measured to see how tall they were.
             The measured height data were recorded on paper as follows:
          </b>
          <p>
          <div class="textLeft">[Table1.1] The height of 10 students in our class (unit cm)</div>

          <b>How can I find out where my height (165cm) is located among students 
             in my class in descending order of height?
          </b>
  </div>
  <p>

  <div class="mainTable">
      <p>Students' heights are called numerical <b>data</b>. In this example, the data 
         was generated as many as the number of students. In our society, a large amount
         of data were generated and the number of data is expected to increase further
         with the development of computer technologies in the future.
      <p>In order to understand the relative position of my height among students, 
         arrange the data in descending order from taller to smaller as shown in [Table 1.2].
      <div class="textLeft">[Table 1.2] Height data in descending order (unit cm)</div>
      <table>
        <td> 175  170  167  165  163  162  161  157  155  153 
        </td>
      </table>
      <p>From this data, it is easy to tell that my height of 165cm is the 4th from the top.
      <p><b>Statistics</b> is the process of collecting, organizing, and summarizing data 
         in this way and obtaining useful information by analysis. A country needs statistics
         such as the number of people, the number of households, and the amount of food 
         in order to solve eating, clothing and sheltering of its people. 
         Such statistics have been recorded since the time of Egyptian civilization 
         5,000 years ago.
      <p>
         As the modern information society progresses, the size of data has grown 
         tremendously, which is called <b>Big Data</b>. Typical examples of big data 
         are as follows:
      <br>
      <div class="textL20M20">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Google‚Äôs search history data
      </div>
      <div class="textL20M20">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- SNS data from your smartphone
      </div>
      <div class="textL20M20">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Records of access to and out of the Internet
      </div>
      <div class="textL20M20">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Telecommunication company's call log data <
      </div>
      <p>In the information society of the future, the success or failure of an individual,
         company, or country can be different depending on how they make scientific 
         decisions with reasonable statistical information on big data. There are many 
         examples of statistics applied to reality by analyzing big data.
      <br>
      <div class="textL20M20">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Predict the number of car models sold in the United States next month by surveying Google's search engine questions about car purchases.
      </div>
      <div class="textL20M20">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- An online shopping mall analyzed customers' web records to find out what products the member customers have and what products they were interested in, and then customized advertisements tailored to each customer, resulting in increased sales.
      </div>
      <div class="textL20M20">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- An oil exploration company increased the success rate of oil drilling by analyzing terabytes of geological data.
      </div>
      <div class="textL20M20">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- A university in the United States analyzed the information that students click on the system in an online class to monitor each student's learning performance, suggested class content for each level tailored to the student's level of understanding, and suggested subjects to take in the future for each student. As a result, the degree acquisition rate by major improved significantly.

  <div class="mainTableYellow">
      <h4>‚≠ê Think</h4>
          <b>If the gender of 10 students in our class is investigated, they are ‚Äòmale‚Äô 
             or ‚Äòfemale‚Äô, and if the height is measured, it is 160cm, etc., gender 
             and height data have different attributes.</b>
      <h4>üíé Explore</h4>
          <b>1) Is there an appropriate way to classify data? <br>
             2) Does the analysis method differ depending on the type of data?
          </b>
  </div>
  <p>

  <div class="mainTable">
      <p>
         Data are values that observe or measure the attributes of objects of interest. 
         The attribute of such an object or event is called a <b>variable</b>. For example, 
         if the gender and height of an elementary school were measured, there were two variables 
         (gender and height). Gender measurements are in the form as male, female, female, male, .... 
         and height measurements are 160cm, 155cm, 158cm, 165cm, ... 
      <p>
         Variable such as 'gender' is classified into qualitative data, and variable such as
         height is classified into <b>quantitative data</b>. The reason for classifying data is 
         that processing and analyzing methods are different depending on the type of data. 
         Chapter 2 discusses visualization of qualitative data, and Chapter 3 discusses 
         visualization of quantitative data.
      <p>
         Qualitative variable such as gender usually have several categories, which are also 
         called a <b>categorical variable</b>. For a categorical variable, the frequency of 
         each category is investigated, a frequency table is created, and a bar graph, 
         pie graph, and band graph are drawn for analysis (Chapter 2). Table 1.3 is an 
         example of a frequency table for gender in a class. It shows that there are 6 'male' 
         and 4 'female' students.
      <div class="textLeft">[Table 1.3]  Frequency table for gender in a class</div>
      <table> 
        <tr> 
          <th class="thGrey">Gender</th>
          <th class="thGrey">Number of Students</th>
        </tr>
        <tr> <td class="tdCenter">Male</td> <td class="tdCenter">6</td> </tr>
        <tr> <td class="tdCenter">Female</td> <td class="tdCenter">4</td> </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
         Qualitative data such as words are analyzed by examining the frequency of each word to form a word cloud.
      <p>
         For quantitative data, the mean and standard deviation are calculated and visualized using stem and leaf plot, histogram, and dot graph (Chapter 3).

      <p>
         Small class data can be manually organized and analyzed, but if there are more data,
         it is impossible to analyze data without the help of a computer. In particular, 
         <b>statistical software</b> with many professional analysis programs is essential for 
         big data analysis. Statistical software such as SAS, SPSS, and R are now widely 
         used for data analysis. However, these software are not easy for beginners to learn, 
         and SAS and SPSS are commercial and are very expensive. In addition, these software 
         are focused on data analysis and there are few modules required for statistical education.
      <p>
         <b>„ÄéeStat„Äè</b> is a free educational software designed to teach statistics easily from 
         elementary school students to college students and general public. Given the data, 
         you can draw a graph with just a click of the mouse, and experience a dynamic graph.
         „ÄéeStat„Äè includes many examples from textbooks of each level, and because 
         it is web-based, users can use it anytime, anywhere with a PC, tablet, 
         or smartphone. „ÄéeStat„Äè is provided free of charge and supports multiple languages,
         and currently 20 languages, including Korean and English are available.
      <p>
         „ÄéeStat„Äè system works 100% well with Google's Chrome among many web browsers currently in use. 
         In browsers such as MS Edge, „ÄéeStat„Äè works, but some functions may not work.
      <p>
         This book is focused on modules in „ÄéeStatM„Äè developed for elementary and middle school 
         students in „ÄéeStat„Äè. Open the web browser Chrome, enter www.estat.me in the address bar 
         and click the icon „ÄéeStatM„Äè, then the screen as shown in &lt;Figure 1.1&gt; appears.
