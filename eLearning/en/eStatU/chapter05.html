  <h3>CHAPTER OBJECTIVES </h3> 
      Similar events occur repeatedly in our everyday life. We describe a chance of the event using a concept of the probability.
      In this chapter, we describe a definition of the probability in Section 5.1. Several rules of calculating the probability is described in Section 5.2.
      There are many possible events in our everyday life which we can calculate the probability of the event. We focus on events which occur frequently and can be modeled as a random variable. Probability of all possible events of the random variable is called a probability distribution function. 
      <br>In section 5.3, probability distributions of the discrete random variable such as Binomial Distribution,
         Poisson Distribution, Geometric Distribution, Hypergeometric Distribution are described. 
      In section 5.4, probability distributions of continuous random variables such as  Normal Distribution, and Exponential Distribution are described.

    <p>Similar events occur repeatedly or are carried out in our everyday life. Let us consider following examples.
    <div class="textL30M10">
      -  A machine produces products repeatedly at a production plant. The product can be either a normal product or a defective product, but it is not known in advance.
    </div>
    <div class="textL30M10">
      -  I have ordered pizza at home every Sunday. It usually takes about 30 minutes for a pizza to be delivered to the house, but the exact time is not known.
    </div>
    <p>These examples have common characteristics as follows.
    <div class="textL30M10">
      -  There is repetition of similar events, such as the production of products or pizza deliveries.
    </div>
    <div class="textL30M10">
      -  We know all possible outcomes of events that the product will be defective or normal, and the pizza delivery time will be 10 minute, 20 minutes, 30 minutes and so on.
    </div>
    <div class="textL30M10">
      -  But we do not know which outcome exactly will happen. 
    </div>
    <p>Events with these three characteristics are subject to study and to apply statistics. 
    <p>An experiment in which a particular outcome occurs among known possible outcomes is called a <b>statistical experiment</b>. In a statistical experiment, the resulting outcome is uncertain and is determined by chance. For example, if you throw a coin, possible outcomes are either the head or tail, but the resulting outcome will come out by chance, so the experiment of tossing a coin is a statistical experiment. If a production plant produces products at one machine and their possible outcomes are either defective or normal, then the experiment of producing a product is a statistical experiment. Also, a pizza delivery time to your home which takes between 20 and 60 minutes is a statistical experiment.
    <p>

      <b>Statistical experiment</b>
      <p>An experiment in which a particular outcome occurs among known possible outcomes. The outcome is uncertain
         and is determined by chance. 
    </div>
    <p>In a statistical experiment, the set of all possible outcomes is referred to as a <b>sample space</b>, 
       and a subset of this sample space is referred to as an <b>event</b>. The sample space is usually denoted by S, and events of the sample space are denoted by English capital letters as A, B, and C ... 
       In the example above that a machine produces a product, the sample space is S = {normal, defective} and a subset of the sample space such as A = {defective} is an event. 
       As such, when the number of elements in a sample space is either finite or countably infinite, it is called a <b>discrete sample space</b>. 
       In a statistical experiment of the pizza delivery time to home, the sample space is all possible time between 20 minutes and 60 minutes, i.e. S = { (20,60) }. 
       Delivery time between 20 minutes and 30 minutes ({20,30}) is called an event. As such, when the number of elements in a sample space is uncountably infinite, it is called a <b>continuous sample space</b>.

      <p>
         A concept of probability is used to indicate the possibility of an event occurring in a statistical experiment. 
         The <b>probability</b> is a representation of the likelihood of an event occurring using a number between 0 and 1. 
         If an event is likely to occur, the probability is expressed as a number close to 1. If it is unlikely to occur, the probability is expressed as a number close to zero. Specifically, there are several ways to define the probability of an event using a number between zero and one. We introduce two definitions of the probability, one is a classical definition and the other is a relative definition of the probability.
    </div>
    <p>

    <div class="mainTableYellow">
      <b>Classical definition of probability</b>
      <p>Assume that all elements in sample space are likely to occur equally. The probability of an event A will occur, denoted as P(A), in case of the discrete sample space is defined as follows: 
      $$ \small
        P(A) = \frac {\text {Number of elements belonging to an event A}} {\text {Total number of elements in sample space}}    
      $$
      <p>The probability of an event A will occur in case of the continuous sample space is defined as follows.
      $$ \small
        P(A) = \frac {\text {Measurement of elements belonging to an event A}} {\text {Measurement of the total elements of a sample space} }    
      $$
      where measurement here can be the length, area and volume etc.

    <div class="mainTableGrey">
      <b>Example 5.1.1</b>
      An office worker went on a business trip to a city and there are two restaurants (Restaurant A and B) near his lodging. He was hesitating about which restaurant to go, and threw a dice to count the number of points that appear on the top. If  he had odd numbers, he would go to the Restaurant A, and if he had even numbers, he would go to the Restaurant B. What is the probability that the Restaurant A would be picked?
      <p>
      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
      The sample space in this statistical experiment, which counts the number of points on the top by throwing a dice, is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, and the number of odd events is {1, 3, 5}, so there are three elements. Therefore, the probability that restaurant A will be selected is 3/6 = 1/2.
    </div>
    <p>

    <!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <div class="mainTableGrey">
      <b>Example 5.1.2</b>
      I ordered a pizza from home every Sunday. The time it takes for a pizza to be delivered my home has the same possibility for any time from 10 to 30 minutes (you may have a decimal number). What is the probability that a pizza will be delivered between 20 and 25 minutes?
      <p>
      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
      The sample space in this example is all values from 10 to 30 minutes collectively { (10,30) }, and where a pizza is delivered between 20 and 25 minutes is the event { (20,25) }. Therefore, the probability of this event is \( \small \frac {(25-20)} { (30-10)}  = 0.25 \) by measuring the distance of the interval.
    </div>
    <p>
    <!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

    <div>
      The classical definition of the probability does not usually have a major problem in calculating the probability of a real problem. However, in the classical definition of the probability, it may not be possible to assume that all elements of the sample space are likely to occur. For example, tossing a coin usually results in ‘Head' and 'Tail' but can be very rarely ’Edge’. Considering this, the assumption that the sample space {'Head’, 'Tail' and 'Edge'} does not make sense that at this time each element of the sample space is likely to occur equally. The relative frequency definition of the probability is to solve these problems.
    </div>
    <p>

    <div class="mainTableYellow">
      <b>Relative frequency definition of probability</b>
      <p>The probability that an event A will occur, denoted by P(A), is the rate at which the event A occurs when many statistical experiments are conducted under the same condition repeatedly. 
    </div>
    <p>

    <div class="mainTable">
      <p>If this definition is used, it can be explained that the coin tossing stands as an 'Edge.' If a coin has been thrown 10,000 times and 'Head' is appeared 4980 times, 'Tail' 5018 times, 'Edge' twice, then P({Head}) = 4980/10000, P({Tail}) = 5018/10000, P({Edge}) = 2/10000. 
         More iterative runs make the definition of the probability using the relative frequency almost approximates to the probability values by the classical definition. 
    </div>
    <p>
    <div class="mainTableGrey">
      <p>&lt;Figure 5.1.1&gt; shows a simulation of a coin toss experiment using 『eStatU』 which shows the probability of ‘Head’ occurrence converges to one-half. This convergence of the probability is called the <b>law of large numbers</b>.

      <p>In order to calculate the probability of an event in a discrete sample space, the number of elements 
         in the sample space and the number of elements included in the event should be counted. 
         If all possible outcomes of the sample space is not large, the probability can be simply calculated, 
         but it is generally not easy to count the number of all possible outcomes. Effective methods 
         for counting the number of complex cases include the permutation and combination.

    <div class="mainTableYellow">
      <b>Permutation</b>
      <p>The number of cases to select r objects out of n objects considering the order is called the

      \[
        _{n} P_{r} =  n (n-1) (n-2)  \cdots (n-r+1) = \frac {n!} {(n-r)!}
      \]
      Therefore, the number of cases to list all n objects is as follows: 
      $$ 
        _{n} P_{n} = n(n-1)(n-2) \cdots 2 \cdot 1 = n!

      <b>Example 5.2.1</b>
      Four people A, B, C and D are intended to be placed on four side-by-side chairs. Calculate the total number of cases in which four people are placed, and the number of cases in which A is placed on the leftmost. What is the probability that A is placed on the leftmost side?
      <p>
      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
      The number of elements in the sample space in this example is as follows.
      $$ \small 
        \begin{multline}
          \shoveleft\text { (number of people that can be placed on the leftmost) } × \\ 
          \shoveleft\text { (number of people except left who can be placed in the second position) } × \\
          \shoveleft\text { (number of people who can be placed in the third place except for two left people) } × \\
          \shoveleft\text { (number of people, excluding the three on the left, who can be positioned to the right) } \\
          \shoveleft = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 4! = 24

      The event in which A is placed on the left is the number of people placed in the second, third, and right positions except A, so 3×2×1 = 3!. Therefore, the probability that A will be placed to the left is as follows.

What is the probability that A will be placed at the front gate?

      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
      The number of elements in the sample space in this problem is as follows.

      The number of elements in the event where A will be placed at the front gate is \( _{3} P_{1} = 3 \), since A can be placed at the front gate and one of the other three can be placed at the rear gate.

      There are several calculation rules for calculating complex probabilities other than the permutation and the combination. Let us consider the examples below to explain the rules.

      <b>Example 5.2.3</b> 
        Out of 40 sophomores in a Statistics Department this semester, 25 students are taking Economics, 30 students are taking Political Science and 20 students are taking both courses. When I meet one of the sophomores, what is the probability of this student taking either Economics or Political Science (that is one or both)?
      <p>
      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
         Since there are 25 students who take Economics and 20 students taking both courses, 25 - 20 = 5 students take only Economics. Also, since there are 30 students who take Political Science, 30 - 20 = 10 students take only Political Science. Thus, as shown in &lt;Figure 5.2.1&gt;, the number of students taking either Economics or Political Science is 5 + 10 + 20 = 35. Therefore, the probability of students taking either Economics or Political Science is 35 / 40.

         <div class="figText">&lt;Figure 5.2.1&gt; Students who take either economics or political science</div>
      <p>
        Consider the case of students taking both Economics (A) and Political Science (B). The event that a student takes both courses are denoted as A ∩ B and is called an intersection event of A and B (&lt;Figure 5.2.2&gt;).

        <div class="figText">&lt;Figure 5.2.2&gt; Intersection events A ∩ B</div>
      <p>
        The event that a student takes either Economics or Political Science (one or both) is denoted as A ∪ B and is called an union event of A and B (&lt;Figure 5.2.3&gt;). 
      <p>

        <div class="figText">&lt;Figure 5.2.3&gt; Union Event A ∪ B</div>
      <p>
        Probabilities of these events on this example are as follows: 
      <p>
        <div class="textL40">
          P(A) = 25 / 40 = 0.625 <br>
          P(B) = 30 / 40 = 0.750 <br>
          P(A ∩ B) = 20 / 40 = 0.500<br>
          P(A ∪ B) = 35 / 40 = 0.875<br>
        </div>
      <p>
        The probability of P(A ∪ B) can also be calculated as follows if you look at the &lt;Figure 5.2.1&gt;.
      <p>
        <div class="textL40">
          P(A ∪ B) = P(A) ＋ P(B) － P(A ∩ B) = 25/40 ＋ 30/40 － 20/40  = 0.625 + 0.750 - 0.500 = 0.875
        </div>
      <p>
        That is, the probability of taking either Economics or Political Science, P(A ∪ B), can be calculated by adding the probability of taking each course and then by subtracting the probability of taking both courses.

      <p>
      In this case, because there are no students taking both courses, the events in which they take Economics (A) and Political Science (B) are mutually exclusive. Thus, the probability to take either Economics or Political Science, P(A U B), is as follows:

      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
      Let us call the event of male as \(\small M \), female as \(\small F\), from Baku as \(\small B\), and from province as \(\small C \). 
      From the table, probabilities of \(\small P(M ∩ B) \), \(\small P(M) \) and \(\small P(B) \) are as follows: 
      <p>
        \( \qquad \small
          P(M ∩ B) = 5/30 \qquad
          P(M) = 10/30 \qquad
          P(B) = 15/30
        \)
      <p>
        Therefore, the following relationship is satisfied:
      <p>
        \( \qquad \small
          P(M ∩ B) = P(M) P(B)
        \)
      <p>
        The events of male and Baku origin are independent of each other. Note that 
      <p>
        \( \qquad \small
          P(M∣B) = 5/15 = 1/3 \qquad
          P(M)=10/30 \qquad
          \text{so, } \;\; P(M∣B) = P(M). 
        \)
      <p>
        In this case, all events of both \(\small M \) and \(\small C \) , \(\small F \)  and \(\small B \) , \(\small F  \) and \(\small C \)  are 
        independent of each other. We call the two attributes, gender and region are independent of each other. 
        In [Example 5.2.5], gender and region are not independent of each other.

      <p>The following is an example of how to calculate the probability of a complementary event.

    <p>

    <!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <div  class="mainTableGrey">
      <b>Example 5.2.8</b>
        There is a box of six products, two of which are defective. What is the probability that at least one defective product will be found when three have been extracted for product testing? Assume that the product is extracted once for inspection without replacement.
      <p>
      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
        The probability of finding one defective in the three product tests is as follows.
      <p>
        \( \qquad \small
          \frac { _4 C_2 \times _2 C_1 } {_6 C_3 }   = \frac {3}{5}. 
        \)
      <p>
        The probability of finding two defective products is as follows.
      <p>
        \( \qquad \small
          \frac { _4 C_1 \times _2 C_2 } {_6 C_3 }   = \frac {1}{5}. 
        \)
      <p>
        Thus, the probability that at least one defect will be found is 3/5 + 1/5 = 4/5. 
        Another way to calculate this probability is to obtain the probability of an event in which there will be no defect (this is called a complementary event) and then, subtract it from 1. In other words, the probability that at least one defective product can be calculated as follows.
      <p>
        \( \qquad \small
       1 - \frac { _4 C_3 } {_6 C_3 }   = 1 - \frac {4}{20} = \frac {4}{5}.

      <p>In case of statistical experiments which are frequently observed around us, there are many 
         similar probability calculations. For example, the problem of tossing coins several times 
         to see how many times the head comes out is similar to counting how many defective products are made 
         from a product line. This problem is also similar to counting the number of voters 
         who support a particular candidate for the presidential election. In this section, 
         the probability calculations as the previous examples, in general the discrete sample spaces are discussed.
      <p>Consider a statistical experiment in which a coin is thrown repeatedly two times. If the coin is ideal, the sample space for this experiment is {'Tail-Tail', 'Tail-Head', 'Head-Tail', 'Head-Head’}. The probability of an event in which each element of the sample space is produced is 1/4 by the classical definition. In most cases, the fact that we are interested in this example will be counting the number of heads or tails. If \(\small X\) is defined as 'the number of heads' in this experiment, the possible value of \(\small X\) can be 0, 1, or 2 and we are interested in calculating probabilities that \(\small X\)=0, \(\small X\)=1 or \(\small X\)=2. As such, a function that corresponds to one real number between [0,1] for each element of the sample space is called a random variable (see Table 5.3.1).

        The random variable \(\small X\) is the mid-term score and its mean and variance are \(\small E(X)\) = 60 and \(\small V(X)\) = 100.
      <p class="textL20M20"> 1) The mean and variance of the new random variable \(\small X\) + 20 are as follows.

        \(\qquad \small V(1.4X) = 1.4^2 V(X) = 1.96 × 100 = 196 \)
      <p>
      <div class="textL20">In other words, if you multiply 1.4 to each score, the mean is increased 1.4 times and

      Examples that are similar to experiments which examine how many times the head comes out by tossing coins are observed around us. Let us take a look at following examples.

    <div class="textL30M10">-  Products produced in a factory machine are inspected and classified as either defective or normal. </div>
    <div class="textL30M10">-  In an election survey, ask voters whether they would vote for a candidate (pro) or not (con).  </div>
    <p>
    <div class="mainTable">
      In these examples there are two possible outcomes such as {defective, normal} and {pro, con} in each experiment and this experiment is repeated, but we do not know what the outcome of each experiment. Each experiment which has two possible outcomes is specifically called a Bernoulli trial, and one outcome of interest in the two is often referred to as 'success' and the other outcome as 'failure'. This Bernoulli trial is usually repeated several times and the number of ‘success’ is counted as following. 
    </div>
    <p>
    <div class="textL30M10">-  Throw a coin five times and examine the number of heads. </div>
    <div class="textL30M10">-  Inspect 100 products produced in a factory and count the number of defective products. </div>
    <div class="textL30M10">-  Count the number of voters in favor of a particular candidate for the presidential election among 50 eligible voters. </div>

    <div class="mainTable"> 
      Counting the number of success on repeated Bernoulli trials can be simulated using the module of ‘Binomial Experiment’ in 『eStatU』. In this module, a ball is dropped from the top and if it hits a blue box, it has one-half chance to fall to the left (get zero point) or right (get one point). The dropped ball again falls to the left and right with a 1/2 chance such as &lt;Figure 5.3.3&gt;. The same experiment is repeated 100 times (drop 100 balls), and we examine the number of balls which got points 0, 1, and 2. It is similar to tossing a coin two times and counting the number of heads.

      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
      This problem is the enforcement of Bernoulli trial in each game of 'win' and 'fail'. This Bernoulli trial is repeated four times. The sample space is all about winning or losing game and there are  elements shown as follows by marking the winning in O and the losing in X.
      <p class="textL30">
        S = {‘XXXX’, ‘OXXX’, ‘XOXX’, ‘XXOX’, ‘XXXO’, ‘OOXX’, ‘OXOX’, ‘OXXO’, ‘XOOX’, ‘XOXO’, ‘XXOO’, ‘OOOX’, ‘OOXO’, ‘OXOO’, ‘XOOO’, ‘OOOO’}
      <p>
      <p class="textL20M20">1) The event that the Tiger will lose all games is {'XXXX'} and the probability of this event is (0.4)×(0.4)×(0.4)×(0.4) = \(\small (0.4)^4\). 
      <p class="textL20M20">2) There are four events that the Tiger is winning once and losing three times such as {‘OXXX’, ‘XOXX’, ‘XXOX’, ‘XXXO’}. 
          These four cases are equal to the number of O's in a single seat when there are four seats which is \(\small{}_4C_1\). 
          Since the probability of each event is (0.6)×(0.4)×(0.4)×(0.4), the probability of the Tiger winning once is \(\small{}_4C_1 (0.6)(0.4)^3\). 
      <p class="textL20M20">3) There are six events that the Tiger is winning two times and losing two times such as {‘OOXX’, ‘OXOX’, ‘OXXO’, ‘XOOX’, ‘XOXO’, ‘XXOO’}. 
          These six cases are equal to the number of O's in two seats when there are four seats which is \(\small{}_4C_2\). 
          Since the probability of each event is (0.6)×(0.6)×(0.4)×(0.4), the probability of the Tiger winning twice is \(\small{}_4C_2 (0.6)^2(0.4)^2\). 
      <p class="textL20M20">4) There are four events that the Tiger is winning three times and losing one time such as {‘OOOX’, ‘OOXO’, ‘OXOO’, ‘XOOO’}. 
          These four cases are equal to the number of O's in three seats when there are four seats which is \(\small{}_4C_3\). 
          Since the probability of each event  is (0.6)×(0.6)×(0.6)×(0.4), the probability of the Tiger winning three times is \(\small{}_4C_3 (0.6)^3(0.4)^1\). 
      <p class="textL20M20">5) There is one event that the Tiger is winning four times such as {‘OOOO’}. 
          This one case is equal to the number of O's in four seats when there are four seats which is \(\small{}_4C_4\). 
          Since the probability of each event  is (0.6)×(0.6)×(0.6)×(0.6), the probability of the Tiger winning all four times is \(\small{}_4C_4 (0.6)^4\). 
      <p class="textL20M20">6) The probability distribution function of the random variable X = ‘the number of games the Tiger wins’ is a summary of the above probabilities.

      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
      Let \(\small X\) be the Poisson random variable with &lambda; = 5. 
      <p>
        1) \(\small P(X = 0) = f(0) = \frac { e^{-5} {5}^{0} } { 0! } \)  = 0.0067 
      <p>
        2) \(\small P(X = 5) = f(5) = \frac { e^{-5} {5}^{5} } { 5! } \)  = 0.1755
      <p>
        3) \(\small P(X \ge 2) = 1 - P(X \le 1) = 1 - P(X=0) - P(X=1) \) = 1 - 0.0067 - 0.0337 = 0.9596

      The binomial distribution is a probability distribution which counts the number of heads when a coin is thrown n times. On the other hand, the number of trials until the head of a coin appears may be of interest. Let us consider the following examples.

    <div class="mainTable">
      In these examples, as with the binomial distribution, we don't know what the outcome of each trial will be, but there are only two possible outcomes such as {pro, con} and {defective, normal}. If we denote one outcome of interest as ‘success’ and the other as ‘failure’, the experiment is the repetition of Bernoulli trials until we have one ‘success’. 'The number of Bernoulli trials until success' is called a <b>geometric random variable</b> and its distribution is called a <b>geometrical distribution</b>. 
      <p>
      The probability of success \(p\) in the geometrical distribution is called a parameter of the geometric distribution.

      Consider a statistical experiment that measures how long it takes for an office worker to get to work from home. 
      Past experience shows that the commuting time usually takes about 30 minutes to get to the work place if the traffic is not congested. 
      While the result of this experiment will have a real number near 30 minutes, we can assume generally that the sample space is larger than zero, and define a random variable \(\small X\) as the 'commuting time to work place'. 
      As such, if a random variable has an infinite number of possible values and it is uncountable, it is called a <b>continuous random variable</b>.
      <p>In case of the continuous random variable, calculating probability at each value of the random variable is meaningless, because there are infinite possible values and the probability at each value is considered zero. Instead of calculating the probability at a single value, the probability of an interval is of interest in case of the continuous random variable. For example, 'What is the probability of a commuting time between 25 and 35 minutes?' In order to obtain this probability, we can divide the sample space of the commuting time into several intervals and count the number of their frequencies and probabilities for 100 days as in Table 5.4.1. &lt;Figure 5.4.1&gt; is a histogram of this table.

      However, if you use this table, you can not calculate, for example, the probability of the commuting time between 25 and 35 minutes. 
      In order to calculate this probability, calculation will require a detail frequency table and a histogram such as &lt;Figure 5.4.2&gt; which has narrower intervals by obtaining more data. 
      If you increase the number of data and make the width of the interval close to zero, this histogram will be approximated to a continuous function as shown in &lt;Figure 5.4.3&gt;. 
      This function is called a <b>probability distribution function of the continuous random variable</b>. As shown in this Figure, many real world data have a bell shape, large amount of data are observed near the mean, symmetrical about the mean. It is called a normal distribution.

        Since the random variable \(\small X\) has the same possibility as any number between 10 and 30, the probability distribution function (uniform distribution) is as follows.

      In real life, there are many continuous data that appear in the form of bell-shape as in &lt;Figure 5.4.3&gt;. The graph shows that large amount of data are located around their mean, fewer data located as it moves away from the mean, and is symmetrical around the mean. This type of data is called a normal distribution. Data obtained from measurements such as the height, weight, and length of bolt often follow the normal distribution. &lt;Figure 5.4.6&gt; shows a simulation of data which follow a normal distribution with the mean 0 and variance 1 using 『eStatU』.

      To make it easier to calculate probability for this type of data in the form of a normal distribution, many mathematicians tried to find a function to describe this distribution type. Abraham de Moivre (1667-1754) was the first who discovered the function, and then Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) extensively applied to physics and astronomy. This function is called a normal distribution function or a Gaussian distribution function and the functional form is as follows.
      $$
        f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 &pi;} \, \sigma } exp \{ - \frac {(x-\mu)^2 } {2 \sigma^2} \}

      The normal distribution is the most frequently used distribution in statistics. If \(\small X\) is a normal random variable with mean &mu; and variance \(\sigma^2\) , 
      it requires a probability calculation in the interval \( (a,b) \). As described earlier, the probability of \(\small X\) on the interval \( (a,b) \), 
      is the area of f(x) surrounding the X-axis and interval \( (a,b) \) as shown in &lt;Figure 5.4.8&gt;.

      $$
        P(a \lt X \lt b)=  \int_{a} ^{b} {} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 &pi;} \, \sigma } exp \{ - \frac {(x-\mu)^2 } {2 \sigma^2} \}dx

      If X is a normal random variable with the mean &mu; and variance \(\sigma^2\), a standardized random variable \(Z =  \frac {X - \mu}{\sigma} \)  is 
      a normal random variable with the mean 0 and variance 1, i.e., \(Z &sim;  N(0,1)\). This fact implies that, 
      if we can find probabilities of all types of intervals in N(0,1) distribution, then we can also find probabilities of all types of intervals in \(N(\mu, \sigma^2 )\). 
      Therefore, \(N(0,1)\) is called a standard normal distribution or simply \(\small Z\) distribution.

        By using normal probability table, percentile calculations are as follows: 
      <p>
      <div class="textL20M20">
        1) The 95 percentile z, \(\small P(Z \lt z) = 0.95\), in the N(0,1) probability table is 1.645, so the percentile in the \(\small  N(70,10^2 )\) is 70 + 1.645 × 10 = 86.45.

        2) The 95 percentile z of two-sided type, \(\small P(z \lt Z \lt z) = 0.95\) , in the \(\small N(0,1)\) table, can be calculated from \(P(Z \lt z) = 0.975\) which is 1.96.

      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
      If the number of defective products is \(\small X\), \(\small X\) is a binomial distribution with 
      \(n = 100, p = 0.05\). When \(n\) is this large, we calculate the probability approximately using 
      normal distribution. Since the mean of this binomial distribution is \(np\) = 100 × 0.05 = 5, and 
      the variance is \(np(1-p)\) = 100 × 0.05 x (1-0.05) = 4.75, we use the normal distribution 
      \(\small N(5, 4.75)\) to calculate the probability approximately as follows.
      <p>
      1) \( \small P( X \lt 2) = P( Z \lt \frac{2-5}{\sqrt{4.75}} ) = P(Z \lt -1.376) = 0.0845 \)

      2)  \( \small P( 3 \lt X \lt 7) = P( \frac{3-5}{\sqrt{4.75}} \lt Z \lt \frac{7-5}{\sqrt{4.75}} ) = P( -0.918 \lt Z \lt 0.918) = 0.642 \)

      If the life span of a product has the average of 10 hours and follows an exponential distribution, obtain the following probabilities using 『eStatU』. 
      <p>
      <div class="textL20M20">1) What is the probability of a product having a lifespan of less than 5 hours? </div>
      <div class="textL20M20">2) What is the probability of a product having a lifespan more than 10 hours? </div>
      <p>
      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
      In 『eStatU』, select [Exponential Distribution] and enter &lambda; = 10. Click the [Execute] button to reveal the graph shown as &lt;Figure 5.4.16&gt;.
