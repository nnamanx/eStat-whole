      <p>Since a population is generally very large, a survey of the entire population takes lots of time and money. Hence we are trying to estimate characteristics of the population using a set of samples. Estimation of population characteristics using samples is called an inferential statistics. However, there may be some difference between the characteristic of the population and the characteristic of the sample. In order to reduce the difference, several methods of sampling have been studied. The most commonly used one is a simple random sampling which collects samples with the same probability of all elements of the population being selected. 
    </div>
    <p>
    <div class="mainTableYellow">
      <b>Simple Random Sampling</b>
      <p>
      Samples are collected so that all elements of the population are likely to be selected equally.
    </div>
    <p>

    <div class="mainTable">
      In case of the simple random sampling, there are two possible ways to collect samples. One is to include an element selected once again in the population (with replacement), and the other is not to include the selected element back into the population (without replacement). However, in practice, almost all sampling is made without replacement.
      <p>
      Some tools may be needed to ensure that each element of the population is selected equally. 
      We usually use a random number table which is a table of numbers from 0 to 9 without special regularity or 
      partiality. Recently, a random number generator by using a computer which uses the uniform distribution 
      on [0, 1] is widely used to produce a random number. 『eStatU』 provide random number generators for Uniform, 
      Normal and two dimensional Normal distributions.

      <b>Example 6.1.1</b>
      A class has 50 students. Select three of 50 students as samples without replacement by using 『eStatU』. 
      <p>
      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
      In order to select three samples randomly from 50 students, a list of students which assigned serial numbers 
      from one to fifty must be made first. In order to collect samples, select [Random Number Generator] in 『eStatU』 menu.
      Enter (1 and 50) at the box of ‘Uniform’, ‘Integer (without replacement)’, enter 3 at the box of ‘Number of Data’ and click 
      the [Execute] button as shown in &lt;Figure 6.1.1&gt;. These are the random numbers to select students, 
      but your computer might generate different numbers, because it depends on computer.

      The purpose of statistical experiments or surveys is to find out some information about a population. Information about the population usually refers to a characteristic value of the population, such as the mean and variance which are called parameters. Since it is so difficult or costly to investigate the population parameters, they are usually estimated by using characteristic values of a set of samples such as the sample mean and sample variance. &lt;Figure 6.2.1&gt; is a simulation to show the relationship between population data of size 10,000 and sample data (approximately 10%) using 『eStatU』 which shows characteristic values of a population are similar to characteristic values of a set of samples.

      Characteristic values of a set of samples are called sample statistic and the distribution of the sample statistic is called a sampling distribution. The sampling distribution identifies the relationship between the sample statistic and the population parameter and it makes possible to estimate and test a population parameter. In this section, let's first look at the sampling distribution of sample means and find out how to estimate the population mean.

        Some of these sample means are exactly the same as the population mean &mu; = 6, but some others such as 2 or 10 are significantly different. 
        The mean of all possible 25 sample means (indicated by \(\small  &mu;_{\overline X} \)) in Table 6.2.1 is also 6 and 
        the variance (indicated by \(\small  &sigma;_{\overline X}^2 \)) is 4 as follows:

        The population mean is a single value, but there are many possible sample means. 
        The population mean &mu; is called a <b>parameter</b>, which is a characteristic value of the population, 
        and the sample mean is a random variable that can have many different values and is usually expressed with a capital letter such as \(\small  \overline X \)
        which is called an <b>estimator</b> of the parameter &mu;. An observed sample mean, marked \(\small  \overline x \) with a lowercase letter, is called an <b>estimate</b> of &mu;.
      <p>An <b>estimator</b> of the population variance \( &sigma;^2 \) is the sample variance \( S^2 \) and its observed value which is an <b>estimate</b> of \( S^2 \) is denoted as \( s^2 \).

    <div class="mainTable">
      <p>The relationship between the population mean and all possible sample means in [Example 6.2.1] is observed even if the population has a different shape of distribution. If the population is very large, it is not possible to find all possible samples as shown in [Example 6.2.1] and to find a distribution of sample means. Therefore, the following theoretical research has been developed.
      <p>If a population is normally distributed with \( N(&mu;, &sigma;^2 ) \), 
         the distribution of all possible sample means is exactly a normal distribution such as 
         \( N(&mu;, \frac {&sigma;^2 }{n} ) \). 
         If the population is an infinite population with the mean &mu; and variance \( &sigma;^2 \), 
         then the distribution of all possible sample means is approximately a normal distribution 
         such as \( N(&mu;, \frac {&sigma;^2 }{n} ) \) if the sample size is large enough. 
         This is referred to as the Central Limit Theorem, which is a key theory in statistics, specifically summarized as follows.

      When a sample survey is conducted, only one set of samples is selected from the population to estimate a characteristic value of the population, such as the population mean. In general, we consider the sample mean of selected samples as an estimate of the population mean. Do you think this sample mean can estimate the population mean well even if it is only one set of samples? 
      <p>This is a basic question on the estimation that everyone can think about at least once. 
         The sampling distribution of all possible sample means which we studied in the previous section 
         is the answer to this question. That is, whatever a population distribution is, if the sample size
         is large enough, all possible sample means are clustered around the population mean in the form 
         of a normal distribution. Therefore, the sample mean obtained from one set of samples is usually
         close to the population mean. Even in the worst case, the difference between the population mean 
         and sample mean, known as an error, is not so significant, and it is possible to estimate the 
         population mean by using the sample mean. The larger the sample size, the more sample means are 
         concentrated around the population mean based on the central limit theorem and hence 
         we can reduce the error of the estimation.

    <h4>Point Estimation of the Population Mean</h4>
    <p>
    <div class="mainTable">
      A value of one observed sample mean is called a <b>point estimate</b> of the population mean.
      <p>In general, the sample statistic used to estimate a population parameter must have good characteristics, so that the estimate can be accurate. 
         If the average of all possible sample statistics is equal to the population parameter, then the sample statistic has a good chance to estimate the population parameter and it is called an unbiased estimator. In the previous section we found that a sample mean is an <b>unbiased estimator</b> of the population mean. 
      <p>If the value of a sample statistic becomes closer and closer to the population parameter when the sample size grows, 
         the sample statistic is called a <b>consistent estimator</b>. The variance of all possible sample means is closer to zero as the sample size increases by the central limit theorem studied in the previous section, so the sample mean is closer to the population mean. Therefore, the sample mean is a consistent estimator of the population mean. 
      <p>If a sample statistic has the least variance when there are several unbiased estimators for the population parameter, 
         it is called an <b>efficient estimator</b>. The sample mean is also an efficient estimator. Consequently, a sample mean has all good characteristics necessary to estimate the population mean.

    <h4>Interval Estimation of the Population Mean – Known Population Variance</h4>
    <p>
    <div class="mainTable">
      <p>In contrast to the point estimate for the population mean, estimating population mean by using an interval is called an <b>interval estimation</b>. 
         If the population is a normal distribution with the mean &mu;  and variance \(&sigma;^2 \), 
         the distribution of all possible sample means is a normal distribution with the mean &mu; and variance \(\frac {&sigma;^2}{n} \), 
         so the probability that one sample mean will be included in the interval \( &mu; &plusmn; 1.96 \times \frac {&sigma;}{\sqrt{n}} \) is 95% as follows.
      $$\small  
        P(\mu - 1.96 \times \frac {&sigma;}{\sqrt{n}} < \overline X < \mu + 1.96 \times \frac {&sigma;}{\sqrt{n}} ) = 0.95
      $$
      We can rewrite this formula as follows.
      $$\small 
        P(\overline X - 1.96 \times \frac {&sigma;}{\sqrt{n}} < \mu < \overline X + 1.96 \times \frac {&sigma;}{\sqrt{n}} ) = 0.95
      $$
      Assuming &sigma; is known, the meaning of the above formula is that 95% of intervals obtained by applying the formula 
      \(\small  [ \overline {X} - 1.96 \times \frac {&sigma;}{\sqrt{n}}, \overline {X} + 1.96 \times \frac {&sigma;}{\sqrt{n}} ] \) 
      for all possible sample means include the population mean. The formula of this interval is referred to as the 95% confidence interval of the population mean.
      $$\small 
        \left[ \overline {X} - 1.96 \times \frac {&sigma;}{\sqrt{n}}, \overline {X} + 1.96 \times \frac {&sigma;}{\sqrt{n}} \right]
      $$
      <p>Generally, since \(\small  \overline {X} \sim N(&mu;, \frac {&sigma;^2}{n} ) \), the standardized random variable of \(\small \overline X \),
         \(\small Z = \frac {\overline X - \mu}{\frac {\sigma}{\sqrt n}} \), follows the standard normal distribution \(N(0,1)\). 
         Therefore, the following probability of the standard normal random variable \(Z\) is \(1-&alpha;\) . 
      $$\small 
        P \left( -z_{\alpha/2} < \frac {\overline{X} - \mu } {\sigma/\sqrt{n}} < z_{\alpha/2} \right) = P ( -z_{\alpha/2} < Z < z_{\alpha/2} ) =  1 - \alpha
      $$
      This formula can be written as follows: 
      $$\small 
        P \left( \mu - z_{\alpha/2} \frac {\sigma} {\sqrt{n}} <  \overline X  < \mu + z_{\alpha/2} \frac {\sigma} {\sqrt{n}} \right) =  1 - \alpha
      $$
      This formula can also be written as follows: 
      $$\small 
        P \left( \overline X - z_{\alpha/2} \frac {\sigma} {\sqrt{n}} <  \mu  < \overline X + z_{\alpha/2} \frac {\sigma} {\sqrt{n}} \right) =  1 - \alpha
      $$
      The confidence interval for the population mean &mu; is as follows if the population is normally distributed and the population variance \( \sigma^2 \) is known.

      $$\small 
        \left[ \overline X - z_{\alpha/2} \frac {\sigma} {\sqrt{n}} , \overline X + z_{\alpha/2} \frac {\sigma} {\sqrt{n}} \right]

    </div>
    <p>
	
    <div class="mainTable">
      <p>100(1-&alpha;)% here is called a <b>confidence level</b>, which refers to the probability of intervals that will include 
         the population mean among all possible intervals calculated by the confidence interval formula. Usually, we use 0.01 or 0.05 for &alpha;.
         \( z_{&alpha;} \) is the upper &alpha; percentile of the standard normal distribution. 
         In other words, if \(Z\) is the random variable which follows the standard normal distribution, 
         the probability that \(Z\) is greater than \( z_{&alpha;} \) is &alpha;, i.e., 
      $$
        P(Z > z_{&alpha;} ) = &alpha;
      $$
      For example, \( z_{0.025;} \) = 1.96, \( z_{0.95} \) = -1.645, \( z_{0.005} \) = 2.575.  
      <p>&lt;Figure 6.2.6&gt; shows a simulation of the 95% confidence interval for the population mean by extracting 100 sets of samples with the sample size \(n\) = 20 
         from a population of 10,000 numbers which follow the standard normal distribution N(0,1). 
         In this case, 96 of the 100 confidence intervals contain the population mean 0. 
         This result might be different on your computer, because the program use a random number generator which depends on computer. 
         Whenever we repeat these experiments, the result may also vary slightly.

    <h4>Interval Estimation of the Population Mean – Unknown Population Variance</h4>
    <p>
    <div class="mainTable">
      <p>One problem in estimating the unknown population mean by using the formula of the confidence interval in the previous section is that either the population variance may not be known or the population is not normally distributed. If the sample size is large enough, a confidence interval of the population mean can be obtained approximately using the sample variance instead of the population variance on the previous formula. However, if the sample size is small and the sample variance is used, a confidence interval based on the t distribution should be used. 
      <p>The \(t\) distribution was studied by a statistician W. S. Gosset, who worked for a brewer in Ireland, and published his study result in 1907 under the alias Student. 
         So \(t\) distribution is often referred to as Student's \(t\) distribution. The \(t\) distribution is not just a single distribution, 
         but it is a family of distributions under a parameter called a degree of freedom, 1,2, ... , 30, ... and denoted as \(t_1 ,t_2 , ... , t_{30} , ... \)
      <p>
         The shape of the \(t\) distribution is symmetrical about zero (y axis), similar to the standard normal 
         distribution, but it has a tail that is flat and longer than the standard normal distribution. 
         &lt;Figure 6.2.7&gt; shows the standard normal distribution N(0,1) and \(t\) distribution with 3 degrees of freedom at the same time by using the \(t\) distribution module of 『eStatU』.

         </div>
    </div>
    <p>
    <div class="mainTable">
      <p>The \(t\) distribution is closer to the standard normal distribution as degrees of freedom increase above 30. 
         This is why a confidence interval can be obtained approximately by using the standard normal distribution if the sample size is greater than 30. 
         Denote \(t_{n:&alpha;}\) as the 100(1-&alpha;)% percentile of the \(t\) distribution with \(n\) degrees of freedom. 
         For example, \(t_{7:0.05}\) is the 100(1-0.05)=95% percentile of the \(t\) distribution and its value is 1.895 as &lt;Figure 6.2.8&gt;. 
         In the standard normal distribution, this value was 1.645. Since the \(t\) distribution is symmetrical, \(t_{n:&alpha;} = -t_{n:1-&alpha;}\). 
      <p>In order to find a percentile value of the \(t_{7}\)  distribution using 『eStatU』, click on '\(t\) distribution' in the main menu of 『eStatU』 
         and then set the degree of freedom (df) to 7, and set the probability value in the fifth option below the \(t\) distribution graph to 0.95, 
         then \(t_{7:0.05}\) = 1.895 will appear as in &lt;Figure 6.2.8&gt;.

         Consider the interval estimation of the population mean when you do not know the population variance, but assume that the population is a normal distribution.  
         If \( X_1 , X_2 , ... , X_n \) is the random sample of size \(n\) from the normal population, 
         then it can be shown that the distribution of \( \frac {\overline X -\mu}{S/\sqrt{n}} \), where &sigma; is replaced with S, 
         is the \(t\) distribution with \( n-1 \) degrees of freedom. 
      $$\small

      <b>Answer</b>

      Since we do not know the population variance, \(t\) distribution should be used for interval estimation of the population mean.

        As discussed in [Example 6.2.1], the sample variance is also a random variable that can have many values, 
        so it is denoted as \( S^2\) and the observed sample variance as \( s^2\). 
        Table 6.3.1 shows that some of these sample variances are exactly the same as the population variance \( &sigma;^2\) = 8, 
        others such as 0 or 32 are significantly different from 8. The average of all possible sample variances,

      In order to estimate the population variance, the sampling distribution of all possible sample variances 
      should be used. As discussed in [Example 6.3.1], for an infinite population, the mean of all possible 
      sample variances is the population variance. That is, the sample variance \(S^2\) is an unbiased estimator 
      of the population variance \(&sigma;^2\). Therefore, the sample variance is used to estimate the population
      variance. In addition, estimation of the population standard deviation \(&sigma;\) uses the sample standard 
      deviation \(S\), but it should be noted that the sample standard deviation is not an unbiased estimator of 
      the population standard deviation. However, as the sample size increases, there is no significant error

      <p>If we know the relationship between the population proportion and sample proportion, it is possible to estimate the population proportion. In this section, the distribution of all possible sample proportions is discussed in section 6.4.1 and the estimation of the population proportion using the sample proportion is discussed in section 6.4.2.

    <p>

  <h4>6.4.1 Sampling Distribution of Sample Proportions</h4>
  <p>
    <div class="mainTable">
      <p>Consider the sampling distribution of all possible sample proportions by using the following example.

      <b>Example 6.4.1</b>
      Consider a population consists of only 10 employees of a company. When employees' satisfaction level for the company is investigated and the satisfaction is expressed as 1, the complaint is 0 as follows.

      <p class="textLeft">    1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
      <p>
        That is, the population proportion \(p\) of the satisfaction is 0.6 (6 ‘1’s out of 10). 
        Consider all possible samples of size 5 with replacement to obtain a sampling distribution of 
        sample proportions. (It is to illustrate the sample variance of sample proportions, 
        although it is not necessary to extract samples from such a small population.)
      <p>
      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
      <p>The population proportion is  \(p\) = 0.6 and the distribution of ‘1’ and ‘0’ in the population consisting of 10 persons is as &lt;Figure 6.4.1&gt;.

      Until now, we have studied the estimation of a population parameter using a given sample. However, it is often necessary to first determine how large a sample should be before obtaining such a sample. This problem is closely related to the precision of the estimate. We could see in the previous section that the width of the confidence interval was reduced if the sample size is larger. However, as sampling is costly, it usually determines the minimum sample size required to achieve this precision that would satisfy the researcher.

      If the maximum allowable error bound and the confidence level 1-&alpha; are given, the sample size can be

      The solution of \(n\) in the above equation is as follows.

      For this year presidential election, a survey for estimating the 95% confidence interval of a candidate's approval rating is conducted. Determine the size of the sample to be within 2.5% of the maximum allowable error bound. Check this calculation using 『eStatU』.
      <p>
      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
      Since we do not have any information on the population proportion, assume \(\hat p\) = 0.5.
