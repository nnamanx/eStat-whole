        <p>In the case of quantitative data, the central tendency and dispersion of 
           the data are measured and analyzed.
        <br>
           - Central tendency : mean / median <br>
           - Dispersion : variance / standard deviation 
        <br>
           Data for two quantitative variables are measured using a covariance and 
           a correlation coefficient.

          </b>
  </div>
  <p>

  <div class="mainTable">
      <p>
         The <b>average (or mean)</b> is a measure of central tendency of quantitative 
         data and is widely used as a representative value for the data. The mean is 
         the sum of all data and divided by the number of data, which implies the 
         center of gravity of the data. The mean is expressed as \(\mu\) (read mu), 
         and the mean of (Data 4.1) is obtained as follows:
      $$
         \text{Mean} =  \mu = \frac{63 + 60 + 65 + 55 + 77}{5} = \frac{320}{5} = 64
      $$
         When \(n\) number of data is expressed as \(x_1 , x_2 , ... , x_n \), 
         mean is expressed by the following formula.
      <p>
      $$
        \small \mu = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i 
      $$
      <p>
         In general, the mean is very appropriate as a representative value of the data,
         but when there is a very large or a small value in the data, it is greatly 
         affected by this extreme value. In this case, a median can be used. 
         The <b>median</b> is the value in the middle when the data are sorted in order.
         In (Data 4.1), the number of data is 5 which is an odd number, and the 3rd 
         (\(\frac{n+1}{2}\)) number when data is sorted in ascending order is the median as follows: 
      <p>
          <div class="textLeft">Data 4.1) is sorted in ascending order.</div> 
          <div class="textLeft">\(\qquad\)55  60  63  65  77</div>
          <div class="textLeft">Median is the 3rd number in these sorted data which is 63.</div>
      <p>
         If the number of data is 6 which is an even number, how do we find the median? 
         In this case, the median of the data is calculated as the average of the 
         3rd (=\(\frac{n}{2}\) ) and 4th (=\(\frac{n+2}{2}\) ) of the sorted data.
      <p>
         Generally, a median is expressed as \(m\), and, if the number of data is \(n\) , 
         it is calculated as follows:
      <p>
         1) Data are sorted in ascending order.<br>
         2) Check whether the number of data  is an odd number or an even number. <br>
         3) If \(n\) is odd, \(m\) = \( (\frac{n+1}{2})^{th}\)  data in sorted data. <br>
            \(\quad \;\)If \(n\) is even, \(m\) = Average of (\(\frac{n}{2})^{th}\) data \((\frac{n+2}{2})^{th}\) data in sorted data.
      <p>
         In order to see the overall distribution of the weight data, a stem and leaf plot 
         or a histogram discussed in Chapter 3 can be considered, but a dot graph is more useful. 
         In a <b>dot graph</b>, after obtaining the minimum and maximum values of data, the position of 
         each data is calculated on the horizontal axis, and displayed as a dot.
      <p>
         &lt;Figure 4.1&gt; is a dot graph for (Data 4.1). In proportion to the minimum 
         value of 55 and the maximum value of 76, each data is displayed by a dot. 
         The green line is the mean  and the red line is the median. In this data, 
         the mean is located slightly to the right of the median because 77 of the data
         is located to the right of the other four data. That is, the mean is more sensitive
         to an extreme than the median.

      <p>
         Enter students' weight data in 'Data input'. (You can also copy and paste
         the data from the e-book)
      <p>
         When data are entered, the number of data, minimum, maximum, mean, and median are calculated

         In this simulation window, you can move a point with the mouse to see the changes in the 
         mean and median. For example, if you drag the rightmost point and move it to the right, 
         the mean changes but the median does not. That is, the median is not affected by the extreme points.

         and paste the data from the e-book), as shown in &lt;Figure 4.4&gt;, 
         it shows immediately that the number of data is 28, mean –1.79, median –1.90, 
         minimum -10.6, maximum 6.4 degrees.
      <p>
         If you click the [Execute] button, a dot graph as shown in &lt;Figure 4.5&gt;

  </div>
  <p>

  <div class="mainTable">
      <p>
         The degree to which data are scattered is called a <b>dispersion</b>. A simple measure 
         of the dispersion is a <b>range</b> which is the maximum minus the minimum.
      $$
         \text{Range} = \text{Maximum - Minimum}</b>
      $$
         In (Data 4.2), the maximum value is 10 and the minimum value is 4, so the range is 22.
      $$
         \text{Range} = \text{77 - 55 = 22}</b>
      $$      
      <p>
         Since the range is too sensitive to extreme values, a variance or a standard deviation
         is generally used to measure the dispersion. The <b>variance</b> is obtained by 
         squaring the distance between each data value and the mean, and dividing it by 
         the number of data. Therefore, when the data are scattered far from the mean, 
         the variance is large, and when the data are clustered around the mean, 
         the variance is small. The variance is expressed as \(\sigma^2\) (read as sigma squared).
      <p>
         The mean of the data in (Data 4.2)  is as follows:
      $$
          \text{Mean} \quad \mu ~=~ \frac{6+8+7++4+10}{5} ~=~ \frac{35}{5} ~=~ 7
      $$

         The variance is calculated by squaring the distances from the mean to each data 
         value to find the sum, and then finding the mean. That is, it is the average of 
         squared distances.
      $$
        \begin{align}
          \text{Variance} \quad \sigma^{2} &~=~ \frac{ (6-7)^2 + (8-7)^2 + (7-7)^2 + (4-7)^2 + (10-7)^2} {5} \\
                                       &~=~ \frac{20}{5} ~=~ 4
        \end{align}
      $$
        When \(n\) number of data is expressed as \(x_1 , x_2 , ... , x_n\) and the mean
        is expressed as \(\mu\), the variance can be expressed by the following formula.
      $$
        \begin{align}
          \text{Variance} \quad \sigma^{2} ~=~ { {1 \over n} {\sum _{i=1} ^{n} (x_{i} - \mu )^{2}}  } ~~~~	(n:~자료수)  \\
        \end{align}
      $$
      <p>
         The <b>standard deviation</b> is defined as the square root of the variance 
         and denoted by \(\sigma\). The variance is not easy to interpret practically 
         because it is the average of the squared distances, but the standard deviation
         is the square root of the variance, so it can be interpreted as a measure 
         of the average distance between each data value and the mean.
      $$
          \text{Standard deviation} \quad \sigma ~=~ \sqrt{\sigma^2}  \\
      $$
         The standard deviation of (Data 4.2) is  \(\sigma\) = \(\sqrt{\sigma^2}\) = \(\sqrt{4}\) = 2 이다.

            <b>Is there a measure to determine the correlation between two quantitative variables? </b>
  </div>
  <p>

  <div class="mainTable">
      <p>
         Just as the variance is used as a measure of dispersion in one quantitative variable, 
          the following covariance is used in two quantitative variables. When \(n\) number 
          of x and y data are expressed as \( (x_1 , y_1 ), (x_2 , y_2 ), ... , (x_n , y_n ) \),
          and the mean is expressed as \( (\mu_x , \mu_y )\), the <b>covariance</b>
          \(\sigma_{xy}\) can be expressed by the following formula.
      $$
          \text{Covariance} \quad \sigma_{xy} ~ =~ \frac{1}{n} \sum _{i=1} ^{n} (x_{i} - \mu_x ) (y_{i} - u_y )  \qquad (n:\text{ number of data} )
      $$
      <p>
         Covariance implies the total average of the values obtained by multiplying the 
         x-axis distance and the y-axis distance between each data point and the mean point
         of data. Therefore, if there are many points on the upper right and lower left of
         the mean point, the covariance has a positive value, indicating a positive correlation. 
         If there are many points on the upper left and lower right of the mean point, 
         the covariance has a negative value, indicating a negative correlation. However, 
         since covariance can increase in value depending on the unit of data, the following 
         <b>correlation coefficient</b> denoted as \(\rho\) is used as a measure of correlation.
      $$
          \text{Correlation coefficient} \quad \rho ~ =~ \frac{\sigma_{xy}}{\sigma_x \sigma_y} 
      $$
      <p>
         The correlation coefficient is a variation of the covariance and can only have 
         values between -1 and +1. When the correlation coefficient is close to +1, 
         the two variables are said to have a strong positive correlation, and when the 
         correlation coefficient is close to -1, it is said to have a strong negative correlation. 
         When the correlation coefficient is close to 0, there is no correlation between 
         the two variables.
