  <h3>CHAPTER OBJECTIVES</h3> 
      In this chapter, we introduce graphs to visualize the quantitative data such as dot graph, histogram, stem and leaf plot and scatter plot. 
      <br>In Section 3.2, we discuss visualization of single quantitative variable using 『eStat』. Visualization of the quantitative data both without group and with group is discussed.
      In Section 3.3, we discuss visualization of two quantitative variables using the scatter plot of 『eStat』.

  <div class="mainTable">
      Data such as height and weight whose possible values are real numbers are called quantitative data. 
      In order to visualize the quantitative data of a variable, dot graph, histogram, stem and leaf plot are used. In order to visualize the quantitative data of two variables, a scatter plot which utilizes two-dimensional coordinate is used. 
    <p>
      <img class="imgIcon" src="http://www.estat.me/assets/icon/eStat_icon13_dot.png">
      <br>
      A dot graph is used to visualize the quantitative data with smaller number of data counts. In order to draw the dot graph, we first draw the horizontal line and set its scale so that all data can be displayed on the horizontal line by considering minimum and maximum of the data, then mark each of the data values in dot corresponding to its scale. The dot graph makes it easy to see distribution patterns and anomalies of the data. 
    <p>
      <img class="imgIcon" src="http://www.estat.me/assets/icon/eStat_icon14_histo.png">
      If there are too many observations of the quantitative data and therefore there are too many possible values of the data, the dot graph may not have enough space to show all data. In such cases, we divide usually all possible values of the data into several intervals and count the number of data belonging to each of intervals. Using the frequencies of each interval, we draw a histogram which is similar to the bar graph with no spacing between bars. 
      <p>You might ask a question, 'How many intervals do I need to have?' There is no exact answer for the number of intervals, but 52 number of intervals is usually used when there are small number of data. A square root of the number of data is also often used as the number of intervals, but, if the number of intervals is too many, it is not easy to analyze the data sometimes. As far as the number of intervals is concerned, it depends on the analyst's judgement. 
    <p>
      <img class="imgIcon" src="http://www.estat.me/assets/icon/eStat_icon15_stem.png">
      <br>
      A stem and leaf plot is a variation of the histogram which is recently used to visualize the quantitative data. 
      The stem and leaf plot can easily tell range of observations, shape of distribution, and concentration. 
      The name literally shows the data in the form of stems and leaves by considering digits of data values, 
      the first few digits form the stems and the remaining digits form the leaves. In 『eStat』 , 
      the last digit of the data values forms the leaves and the digits in front of them form the stems. 
      For each number of the data, first we investigate where it belongs to a stem and then write down the last digit of the number as a leaf corresponding to the stem. After investigating all numbers in the data, rearrange the values of the leaves on each stem in ascending order. The stem and leaf plot have been commonly used in recent years as both an interval-specific frequency distribution and a histogram for the quantitative data. 
    <p>
      <img class="imgIcon" src="http://www.estat.me/assets/icon/eStat_icon17_scatter.png">
      <br>
      A Scatter plot is to visualize data of two quantitative variables using two dimensional coordinates. 
      The scatter plot can be considered as an extension of the dot graph for single quantitative variable. 
      Each pair of the data of two quantitative variables is expressed as a dot with one value on the X-axis 
      and the other value on the Y-axis in the XY plane. By using the scatter plot, relationship between 
      two quantitative variables can be observed efficiently. 
    <p>
      In this chapter, visualization of the quantitative data is discussed by separating cases of the data 
      without group and with group. Visualization of the quantitative data is a basic step of statistical analysis 
      that will be described over the next chapters 7 to 12. It is an exploratory data analysis before 
      you get into some statistical analysis. Estimation and testing hypothesis for the quantitative data 
      of single population are described in Chapter 6 and 7. Testing hypothesis for the quantitative data 
      of two populations is described in Chapter 8. Testing hypothesis for the quantitative data of three 
      or more populations is described in Chapter 9.

      In case of the quantitative data, raw data are directly used to visualize the data. Visualization of the quantitative data is discussed by separating cases of the data without group and with group. 
  <p>
  <h4>3.2.1 Visualization of Quantitative Data without Group</h4>
  <p>

  <div class="mainTable">
      If the quantitative data are the sample data from a population, visualization of this sample data is used as a basic exploratory data analysis for estimation and testing hypothesis of population parameters such as population mean and population variance (Chapters 6 and 7).

      If you can visualize the quantitative data by several groups using the same scale, it is easy to compare characteristics of groups. If the data are the sample data taken from two or more populations (groups), this comparison by visualization  can be used as a basic exploratory data analysis for testing hypothesis in Chapter 8 and Chapter 9.

      In general, we investigate several characteristics from one subject or one observation. For example, when we investigate students in an elementary school, we examine their gender, height and weight simultaneously which are one categorical and two quantitative variables. 
      <p>If you have data on two quantitative variables, a scatter plot can be used to analyze the data. A scatter plot displays the data on a two-dimensional plane with values for one variable being X-axis and values for the other being Y-axis. If a categorical variable such as gender is also collected together, a scatter plot by differenciating the colors of the dots by gender can be drawn. 
      <p>If data are sampled from a population, the scatter plot can be used to analyze correlation and regression which will be discussed in Chapter 12.    </td>

            By clicking on the scatter plot icon <img class="imgIcon" src="http://www.estat.me/assets/icon/eStat_icon17_scatter.png">
            and clicking on the 'weight' and 'height’ variable names, a scatter plot with the weight on Y-axis (the first selected variable) and the height on X-axis (the second selected variable) will appear in the Graph Area as in &lt;Figure 3.3.1&gt;. 
            You can also select 'weight' in the 'Y-variable' selection box and 'height in the 'by X-variable' selection box.

        By checking the 'Regression' in the options window below the graph shows a scatter plot with a regression line as in &lt;Figure 3.3.2&gt; which indicates a relationship between weight and height. If you look at the scatter plot, you can see that the larger the height, the heavier the weight is. See Chapter 12 for more discussion on the regression analysis.
