  <h3>CHAPTER OBJECTIVES</h3> 
    Estimation of population parameters using sample distributions was discussed in Chapter 6. 
    However, one might be interested in which one of two hypothesis about the population parameter is reasonable to accept. 
    This problem is called a testing hypothesis and we take samples and calculate the sample statistics to decide by using the sampling distributions discussed in Chapter 6. 
    <p>In this chapter we discuss the testing hypothesis of the population mean, population variance and population proportion.
    A method of testing hypothesis which considers both type 1 and type 2 error is also introduced.

      <p>Testing hypothesis is the answer to the above questions (hypothesis). That is, the testing hypothesis is to decide statistically which hypothesis is to use for the two hypotheses about the unknown population parameter using samples. In this section, we examine the test of the population mean, population variance, and population proportion which are most commonly used in testing hypothesis.
      <p>The following example explains the theory of testing hypothesis of the population mean in single population.

      <p>
      <b>Example 7.1.1</b>
      At a light bulb factory, the average life expectancy of a light bulb made by a conventional production method is known 
      to be 1500 hours and the standard deviation is 200 hours. Recently, the company is trying to introduce a new production method, 
      with the average life expectancy of 1600 hours for light bulbs. To confirm this argument, 30 samples were taken from 
      the new type of light bulbs by simple random sampling and the sample mean was \(\small \overline x \) = 1555 hours. 
      Can you tell me that the new type of light bulb has the average life of 1600 hours?
      <p>
      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
      A statistical approach to the question of this issue is first to make two assumptions about the different arguments 
      for the population mean &mu; . Namely,
      $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft H_0 : &mu; = 1500 \\ 
        \shoveleft H_1 : &mu; = 1600
        \end{multline}
      $$
      \(\small H_0\) is called a null hypothesis and \(\small H_1\) is an alternative hypothesis. 
      In most cases, the null hypothesis is defined as an ‘existing known fact’, and the alternative hypothesis is defined as 
      ‘new facts or changes in current beliefs’. So when choosing between two hypotheses, the basic idea of testing hypothesis 
      is 'unless there is a significant reason, we accept the null hypothesis (current fact) without choosing the alternative 
      hypothesis (the fact of the matter). This idea of testing hypothesis is referred to as a ‘conservative decision making’.
      <p>
      A common sense criterion for choosing between two hypotheses would be 'which population mean of two hypothesis is 
      closer in distance to the sample mean'. Based on this common sense criteria which uses the concept of distance, 
      the sample mean of 1555 is closer to \(\small H_1 : &mu; = 1600\) so the alternative hypothesis will be chosen. 
      A statistical testing hypothesis is based not only on this common sense criteria, but also on the sampling distribution of \(\small \overline X\). 
      In other words, the statistical testing hypothesis is to select a critical value \(C\) based on the sampling distribution theory and to make a decision rule as follows: 
      <p>
      \( \small
        \qquad \text {  ‘If \(\overline X\) is smaller than C, then the null hypothesis \(H_0\) will be chosen, else reject \(H_0\)’}
      \)
      <p>
      The area of {\(\small \overline X &lt; C\)} is called an acceptance region of \(\small H_0\) and the area {\(\small \overline X &ge; C\)} is called 
      a rejection region of \(\small H_0\) (&lt;Figure 7.1.1&gt;).
      <p>
      <img class="imgFig400300" src="./Figure/Fig070101.png">
      <div class="figText">&lt;Figure 7.1.1&gt;  Acceptance and rejection region of  \(H_{0}\)</div>
      <p>
      If a hypothesis is chosen by this decision rule, there are always two possible errors in the decision. 
      One is a <b>Type 1 Error</b> which accepts \(\small H_1\) when \(\small H_0\) is true, 
      the other is a <b>Type 2 Error</b> which accept \(\small H_0\) when \(\small H_1\) is true. 
      These errors can be summarized as Table 7.1.1.
      <p> 
      <p class="textLeft">Table 7.1.1  Two types of errors in testing hypothesis

        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        If you try to reduce one type of error when the sample size is fixed, then the other type of error is increasing. 
        That is why we came up with a conservative decision making method that defines the null hypothesis \(\small H_0\)
        as 'past or present facts' and 'accept the null hypothesis unless there is a significance evidence for the 
        alternative hypothesis.' In this conservative way, we try to reduce the type 1 error as much as possible that selects
        \(\small H_1\)  when \(\small H_0\) is true, which would be more risky than the type 2 error. Testing hypothesis 
        determines the tolerance for the probability of the type 1 error, usually 5% or 1% for rigorous test, 
        and use the selection criteria that satisfy this limitation. The tolerance for the probability that this 
        type 1 error will occur is called the <b>significance level</b> and is often expressed as &alpha;. 
        The probability of the type 2 error is expressed as &beta;.
      <p>
        If the significance level is established, the decision rule for the two hypotheses can be tested using the 
        sampling distribution of all possible sample means in Chapter 6. &lt;Figure 7.1.2&gt; shows the distribution 
        of populations for two hypotheses, and the distribution of all possible sample means for each population.
      <p>
       <img class="imgFig400300" src="./Figure/Fig070102.png">
        <div class="figText">&lt;Figure 7.1.2&gt; Testing Hypothesis</div>
      <p>
        If the population corresponds to the distribution of \(\small H_0\) : &mu; = 1500, the sampling distribution of 
        all possible sample means is approximated as \(\small N(1500,200^2 )\) by the central limit theorem. 
        If the population corresponds to the distribution of \(\small H_1\) : &mu; = 1600, the sampling distribution of 
        all possible sample means is approximated as \(\small N(1600,200^2 )\). The standard deviation for each population is 
        assumed to be 200 from a historical data. Then the decision rule becomes as follows: 
      <p>
      \( \small
        \qquad \text {‘If \(\overline X &lt; C\), then accept \(H_{0}\), else accept \(H_{1}\) (i.e. reject \(H_{0}\) )’}
      \)
      <p>
        In Figure 7.1.2, the shaded area represents the probability of the type 1 error. If we set the significance level, 
        which is the tolerance level of the type 1 error, is 5%, i.e. \(\small P(\overline X &lt; C) = 0.95\), \(C\)  
        can be calculated by finding the percentile of the normal distribution \(\small N(1500,\frac{200^2}{30})\) as follows: 
      <p>
      \( \small
        \qquad 1500+1.645 \frac{200}{\sqrt 30 } = 1560.06
      \)
      <p>
      Therefore, the decision rule can be written as follows.
      <p>
      \( \small
        \qquad \text {‘If \(\overline X\) < 1560.06, then accept \(H_0 \), else reject \(H_0\)  (accept \(H_1\) ).’}
      \)
      <p>
        In this problem, the observed sample mean of the random variable \(\small \overline X\) is 
        \(\small \overline x\)= 1555 and \(\small H_0 \) is accepted. In other words, the hypothesis of 
        \(\small H_0 \) : &mu; = 1500  is judged to be correct, which contradicts the result of 
        common sense criteria that \(\small \overline x\) = 1555 is closer to \(\small H_1 \) : &mu; = 1600
        than \(\small H_0 \) : &mu; = 1500. This result can be interpreted that the sample mean
        of 1555 is not a sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis by a conservative decision making method. 
      <p>
      The above decision rule is often written as follows, emphasizing that it is the result from a conservative decision making method. 
      <p>
      \( \small
        \qquad \text {‘If \(\overline X\)  &lt; 1560.06, then do not reject \(H_0\), else reject \(H_0 \).’}
      \)
      <p>
      In addition, this decision rule can be written for calculation purpose as follows.
      <p>
      \( \small
        \qquad \text {‘If \(\frac{\overline X - 1500}{\frac {200}{\sqrt{30}}}\), then accept \(H_0\) , else reject \(H_0\).’}
      \)
      <p>
      In this case, since \(\small\overline x\) = 1555, \(\frac{1555 - 1500}{\frac {200}{\sqrt{30}}}\) 
      and it is less than 1.645. Therefore, we accept \(\small H_0\). 
    </div>
    <!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <p>

    <div class="mainTable">
      Since the testing hypothesis by the conservative decision making is only based on the probability of 
      the type 1 error as seen in [Example 7.1.1], even if the alternative hypothesis is \(H_1 : &mu; &gt; 1500\), 
      we will have the same decision rule. 
      <p>
      Generally, there are three types of alternative hypothesis in the testing hypothesis for the population mean as follows.
      $$ 
        \begin{align}
          & 1)\quad H_1 : \mu \gt \mu_0  \\
          & 2)\quad H_1 : \mu \lt \mu_0  \\
          & 3)\quad H_1 : \mu \ne \mu_0  \\
        \end{align}
      $$
      Since 1) has the rejection region on the right side of the sampling distribution of all possible sample means 
      under the null hypothesis, it is called a <b>right-sided test</b>. Since 2) has the rejection region on the left side
      of the sampling distribution, it is called a <b>left-sided test</b>. Since 3) has rejection regions on both sides 
      of the sampling distribution, it is called a <b>two-sided test</b>. The decision rule for each type of three 
      alternative hypothesis are summarized in Table 7.1.2 when the population standard deviation is known and 
      &alpha; is the significance level.

      $$\small
        \frac {\overline X - \mu_0}{ \frac {\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} }
      $$	
      <p>The population standard deviation &sigma; of the test statistic is usually unknown. However, if the sample is large enough 
         (approximately 30 or more), the hypothesis test can be performed using the sample standard deviation \(S\) 
         instead of the population standard deviation &sigma;.
      <p>In [Example 7.1.1], if the sample mean is either 1555 or 1540, the null hypothesis can not be rejected, 
         but degrees of evidence that the null hypothesis is not rejected are different. 
         The degree of evidence that the null hypothesis is not rejected is measured by calculating the probability of the type 1 error 
         when the observed sample mean value is considered as the critical value for decision, which is called the \(p\)-value. 
         That is, the \(p\)-value indicates where the observed sample mean is located among all possible sample means by 
         considering the location of the alternative hypothesis. In [Example 7.1.1], the \(p\)-value for \(\small\overline X\) = 1540 
         is the probability of sample means which is greater than \(\small\overline X\) = 1540 by using \(N(1500, \frac{200^2}{30} )\). 
         The higher the \(p\)-value, the stronger the reason for not being rejected. If \(H_0\)  is rejected, the smaller 
         the \(p\)-value, the stronger the grounds for being rejected. Therefore, if the \(p\)-value is less than the significance level 
         considered by the analyst, then \(H_0\) is rejected, because it means that the sample mean is in the rejection region. 
         Statistical packages provide this \(p\)-value.

      <p>The testing hypothesis of the population mean using the sample variance requires the assumption 
         that the population is normally distributed. Testing whether sample data come from a normal population
         is called a goodness of fit test which will be explained in Chapter 11. 
      <p>In this section, we looked at the testing hypothesis for the population mean when the sample size 
         is already given and only the significance level of the type 1 error is considered. In this case, 
         if we try to reduce the probability of the type 1 error, then the probability of the type 2 error 
         will be increased and we can not reduce both types of errors at the same time. 
         Therefore, if the sample size was predetermined, or if data were given, only the type 1 error 
         was considered as a conservative decision making to test the hypothesis. However, if the sample size 
         can be selected by a researcher, there is a testing hypothesis that considers both types of errors

      If you understand the testing hypothesis for the population mean, the testing hypothesis 
      for the population variance differs only from the sampling distribution and the test statistic, 
      but the basic concept is the same. In Chapter 6, we studied that the distribution of all possible 
      sample variances multiplied by a constant, \(\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\sigma^2}\), follows a chi-square 
      distribution with \(n-1\) degrees of freedom when the population is a normal distribution

      It is necessary to assume that the population is normally distributed to test the hypothesis 
      of the population variance. Testing whether the population is normally distributed using 
      sample data is called a goodness of fit test which will be discussed in Chapter 11. 
      You may test the normality approximately by using a histogram with a normal distribution 
      which can be drawn from the option box in &lt;Figure 7.2.5&gt;. In addition, [Normal Q-Q Plot] 
      can be used to test the normality.

      Since the testing hypothesis we have learned so far is a conservative decision making method, 
      we first decide a critical value that reduces the probability of the type 1 error &alpha; 
      (the error that rejects the null hypothesis even though it is true). This decision rule is 
      intended to keep the null hypothesis unless there is a sufficient evidence of the alternative 
      hypothesis which is a new fact or risky.  Thus, the probability of the type 2 error &beta; was 
      not considered at all in the decision rule. However, sometimes it is unclear which one should be 
      the null hypothesis and which one should be the alternative hypothesis. Depending on the problem, 
      both types of errors are important and should be considered simultaneously. If the analyst 
      can determine the sample size, a testing hypothesis that takes into account both &alpha; and &beta;
      can be performed.

      <p>
      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
        The hypothesis in [Example 7.1.1] is \(\small H_0 : \mu = 1500, H_1 : \mu  = 1600\), the population 
        standard deviation is assumed &sigma; = 200, the sample size is \(n\) = 30 and hence the 
        decision rule is as follows if the significance level is 5%. 
      <p>
      \( \small
        \qquad '\text{If } \overline X \lt 1500 + 1.645 \times \frac {200}{30} = 1560.06, \text{ reject } H_0,\text{ else accept } H_0’

      <p>
        Hence the type 2 error which is the probability of '\(\small H_0\) is true when \(\small H_1\) is true’

          1) Although the alternative hypothesis has been changed to \(\small H_1 : \mu = 1580\), the decision rule will not be changed in case of the conservative decision making, because the alternative hypothesis is the same type of \(\small H_1 : \mu > 1500\).

      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
      Although the alternative hypotheses are different, the decision rule is the same as follows: 
      <p>
        \( \qquad \small '\text{If } \overline X \lt 1500 + 1.645 \times \frac {200}{30} = 1560.06, \text{ reject } H_0,\text{ else accept } H_0’\)
      <p>
      Hence if we calculate the probability of the type 2 error as [Example 7.4.2], the power of each test is as follows: 
      <table style="width:500px"> 
        <tr> 
          <th class="thGrey" style="width:200px">Alternative Hypothesis</th>

      In case of a two sided test, the power function is a V-shaped, because the type 2 error may appear on either side of the null hypothesis. If the V-shaped valley is deep, it is generally considered to have highly discriminating ability against the null hypotheses.

  <h4>7.4.2 Testing Hypothesis with &alpha; and &beta;</h4>
    <div class="mainTable">
      If the sample size is not predetermined and the analyst can determine it, the testing hypothesis 
      can be performed with the desired level of &alpha; and &beta;  as following example. 
    </div>
    <p>

    <!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <div class="mainTableGrey">
      <b>Example 7.4.4</b>
      Consider the testing hypothesis on the bulb life such as \(\small H_0 : \mu = 1500, H_1 : \mu = 1570 \). 
      Find the sample size \(n\) and the decision rule which satisfies &alpha; of 5% and &beta; of 10%. 
      Assume that the population standard deviation &sigma;  is 200 hours. Check the result using 『eStatU』.
      <p>
      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
      Let \(n\) be the sample size and \(\small C\) be the critical value of a decision rule. The probability 
      of the type 1 error &alpha; and the probability of the type 2 error &beta; are defined as follows: 
      $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft \alpha = P(\overline X \gt C | H_0 \text{ is true } ) \\
        \shoveleft \beta = P(\overline X \lt C | H_1 \text{ is true } ) \\
        \end{multline}
      $$
      If \(\small H_0\) is true, the sampling distribution of \(\small \overline X\) is 
      \(\small N(1500, \frac{200^2}{n})\) and if \(\small H_1\) is true, the sampling distribution of 
      \(\small \overline X\) is \(\small N(1570, \frac{200^2}{n})\). 
      If  &alpha; = 0.05 and &beta; = 0.10, then \(z_{0.05}\) = 1.645 and  \(z_{0.90}\) = -1.280. 
      Hence \(n\) and \(\small C\) should satisfy both of the following equations and they can be calculated 
      by solving the two system of equations. 
      $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft C = 1500 + 1.645 \times \frac{200}{\sqrt{n}} \\
        \shoveleft C = 1570 - 1.280 \times \frac{200}{\sqrt{n}} \\
        \end{multline}
      $$
      The solution is \(n\) = 69.9, \(\small C\) = 1539.4. i.e., the sample size is 70 approximately and the decision rule is as follows: 
      $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft '\text{If } \overline X \gt 1539.4, \text { then reject } H_0, \text { else accept } H_0’
        \end{multline}
      $$
      Select [Testing &mu; - \(C, n\)] at 『eStatU』 menu. Enter \(\mu_0 = 1500 ,\mu_1 = 1570 , \sigma = 200, \alpha = 0.05 \),
      \( \beta = 0.10 \) in the input box window as &lt;Figure 7.4.4&gt;. 
      <p>
         If you click the [Execute] button, you will see the test result of 『eStatU』 as in &lt;Figure 7.4.5&gt;. The critical value  and the sample size  are calculated.
