  <h3>CHAPTER OBJECTIVES</h3> 
    In Chapter 7, we discussed how to test hypotheses about parameters in a single population. 
    In this chapter, we discuss testing hypothesis to compare population parameters of two populations.
    <p>Section 8.1 discusses a t-test for testing hypothesis of two population means when samples are independent and when samples are paired.
    Section 8.2 discusses a F-test for testing hypothesis of two population variances.
    Section 8.3 discusses a Z-test for testing hypothesis of two population proportions when samples are large enough.

    <div class="mainTable">
      There are many examples comparing means of two populations as follows: 
      <p>
      <div class="textL30M10">
        -  Is there a difference between the starting salary of male graduates and of female graduates in this year’s college graduates?
      </div>
      <div class="textL30M10">
        -  Is there a difference in the weight of the products produced in the two production lines?
      </div>
      <div class="textL30M10">
        -  Did the special training for typists to increase the speed of typing really bring about an increase in the speed of typing?
      </div>
      <p>
      As such, a comparison of the two population means (\(\mu_1\) and \(\mu_2\)) is possible by testing hypothesis that the difference in the population means is greater than, or less than, or equal to zero. The comparison of two population means differs depending on whether samples are extracted independently from each population or not (referred to as paired samples).
      <p>
    </div>
    <p>

    <h4>8.1.1 Two Independent Samples</h4>
    <p>
    <div class="mainTable">
      Generally, testing hypothesis for two population means can be divided into three types, 
      depending on the type of the alternative hypothesis as follows.
      $$ 
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft 1)\quad H_0 : \mu_1 - \mu_2 = D_0 \qquad H_1 : \mu_1 - \mu_2 \gt D_0 \\
        \shoveleft 2)\quad H_0 : \mu_1 - \mu_2 = D_0 \qquad H_1 : \mu_1 - \mu_2 \lt D_0 \\
        \shoveleft 3)\quad H_0 : \mu_1 - \mu_2 = D_0 \qquad H_1 : \mu_1 - \mu_2 \ne D_0 \\
        \end{multline}
      $$
      Here \(D_0\) is the value for the difference in population means to be tested. 
      <p>
      When samples are selected independently from each other in the population, 
      the estimator of the difference of the population means \(\mu_1 - \mu_2\) is the difference 
      in sample means \(\small {\overline x}_1 - {\overline x}_2\). The sampling distribution of 
      all possible sample mean differences is approximately a normal distribution with the mean
      \(\mu_1 - \mu_2\) and variance \(\frac{\sigma^2_1}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma^2_2}{n_2}\) 
      if both sample sizes are large enough.
      <p>
      Since the population variances \( \sigma^2_1 \) and \( \sigma^2_2 \) are usually unknown, 
      estimates of these variances, \( s^2_1 \) and \( s^2_2 \), are used to test the hypothesis. 
      The test statistic differs slightly depending on the assumption of two population variances.
      If two populations follow normal distributions and their variances can be assumed the same,
      the testing hypothesis for the difference of two population means uses the following statistic.
      $$ \small 
        \frac { ({\overline x}_1 - {\overline x}_2 ) - D_0 }{\sqrt{\frac{s^2_p}{n_1} +\frac{s^2_p}{n_2} } } 
        \qquad \text{where } s^2_p  = \frac{(n_1 -1 )s^2_1 + (n_2 -1)s^2_2}{n_1 + n_2 -2}
      $$
      \(s^2_p\) is an estimator of the population variance called as a <b>pooled variance</b> 
      which is an weighted average of two sample variances \( s^2_1 \) and \( s^2_2 \) by using 
      the sample sizes as weights when population variances are assumed to be the same. 
      <p>
      The above statistic follows a \(t\)-distribution with \(n_1 + n_2 -2\) degrees of freedom 
      and it is used to test the difference of two population means as follows:

      <b>Example 8.1.1</b>
      Two machines produce cookies at a factory and the average weight of a cookie bag should be 270g. Cookie bags were sampled from each of two machines to examine the weight of the cookie bag. The average weight of 15 cookie bags extracted from the machine 1 was 275g and their standard deviation was 12g, and the average weight of 14 cookie bags extracted from the machine 2 was 269g and the standard deviation was 10g. Test whether weights of cookie bags produced by two machines are different at the 1% significance level. Check the test result using 『eStatU』.
      <p>
      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
      The hypothesis of this problem is \(\small H_0 : \mu_1 = \mu_2 ,\, H_1 : \mu_1 \ne \mu_2 \). Hence the decision rule is as follows.
      $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft '\text{If } \left | \frac { ({\overline x}_1 - {\overline x}_2 ) - D_0 }{\sqrt{\frac{s^2_p}{n_1} +\frac{s^2_p}{n_2} } } \right | > t_{n_1 + n_2 -2; &alpha;/2} , \text{ then reject } H_0 ’ \\
        \end{multline}
      $$
      where \(\small D_0 = 0\) and the information in this example can be summarized as follows.
      $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft n_1 = 15,\quad \overline x_1 = 275,\quad s_1 = 12 \\
        \shoveleft n_2 = 14,\quad \overline x_2 = 269,\quad s_2 = 10 \\
        \end{multline}
      $$
      Therefore, the calculation of the statistics are as follows.
      $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft s^2_p  = \frac{(n_1 -1 )s^2_1 + (n_2 -1)s^2_2}{n_1 + n_2 -2} 
          = \frac{(15 - 1 ) 12^2 + (14 - 1) 10^2}{15 + 14 -2} = 122.815 \\
        \shoveleft \left | \frac {275 - 269} { \sqrt{\frac{122.815}{15} +\frac{122.815}{14} } } \right | = 1.457 \\
        \shoveleft t_{15 + 14 -2; 0.01/2} = t_{27: 0.005} = 2.7707 \\
        \end{multline}
      $$
      Since 1.457 &lt; 2.7707, \(H_0\) can not be rejected. 
      <p>In 『eStatU』 menu, select [Testing Hypothesis \(\mu_1 , \mu_2\)]. At the window shown in &lt;Figure 8.1.1&gt;, 
      check the alternative hypothesis of not equal case at [Hypothesis], check the variance assumption of 
      [Test Type] as the equal case, check the significance level of 1%, check the independent sample, 
      and enter sample sizes \(n_1 , n_2\), sample means \(\small \overline x_1 , \overline x_2\), and sample variances
      as in &lt;Figure 8.1.1&gt;.

      <p>
      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
      Since the population variances are different, the degrees of freedom  of  distribution is approximated as follows: 
      $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft \phi = \frac { \left( \frac{12^2}{15} + \frac{10^2}{14} \right)^2 }

      The testing hypothesis for two population means in the previous section is based on two samples 
      extracted independently from each population. However, in some cases it is difficult to extract 
      samples independently, or if samples are extracted independently, then the resulting analysis 
      may be meaningless, because characteristics of each sample differ too much. 
      <p>
      For example, you want to give typists a special education to increase the speed of typing 
      and want to see if this training has been effective in the speed of typing. In this case, 
      if different samples are extracted before and after education, it is difficult to measure 
      the effectiveness of education because individual differences are severe. In order to overcome 
      the individual difference for a typist who has sampled before training education, if you measure 
      the typing speed before and after the training for the typist, the effect of special education 
      can be well understood. 
      <p>
      A hypothesis test that uses same samples to perform similar experiments to compare means of 
      two populations is called a paired comparison. In the paired comparison, we calculate the 
      difference (\(d_i\)) between paired data \(x_{i1}\) and \(x_{i2}\) as shown in Table 8.1.3 
      and obtain the mean of differences (\(\overline d\)) and variance of differences (\(s_{d}^2\)).

      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
      This problem is for testing the null hypothesis \(\small H_0 : \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0 \) to the alternative hypothesis
      \(\small  H_1 : \mu_1 - \mu_2 < 0 \) to compare the typing speed of typists before training (population 1) and 
      after training (population 2) using paired samples. Therefore, the decision rule is as follows.
      $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft \text{If } \frac{\overline d - D_0}{\frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}} < - t_{n-1; &alpha;}, \text{ then reject } H_0 \\
        \end{multline}
      $$
      Calculated differences (\(d_i\)) of paired samples before and after training, the mean (\(\overline d\)) 
      and standard deviation (\(s_d\)) of differences are as follows.

            Standard deviation of \(d_i\) : \(s_d = 3.162 \)
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>  
      <p>
      The test statistic is as follows: 
      $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft \frac{\overline d - D_0}{\frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{-3.5}{\frac{3.16}{\sqrt{8}}} = -3.130 \\
        \shoveleft - t_{n-1; &alpha;} = - t_{8-1: 0.05} = - t_{7: 0.05} = -1.895 \\
        \end{multline}
      $$
      Therefore, \(\small H_0\) is rejected and we conclude that the training increased the typing speed.

      Consider following examples to compare two population variances.
      <p>
      <div class="textL30M10">
        -  When comparing two population means in the previous section, we studied that if the sample size was small, the decision rule for testing hypothesis were different depending on whether two population variances were the same or different. So how can we test whether two population variances are the same? 
      </div>
      <div class="textL30M10">
        -  The quality of bolts used to assemble cars depends on the strict specification for their diameters. Average diameters of bolts produced by two factories were said to be the same and if the variance of diameters is smaller, it is considered as superior production. How can you compare variances of the diameter?  
      </div>
      <p>
        When comparing variances (\(\sigma_1^2\) and \(\sigma_2^2\)) of two populations, 
        the ratio (\(\frac{\sigma_1^2}{\sigma_2^2}\)) of variances is calculated instead of comparing 
        the difference in variances. If the ratio of variances is greater, smaller, or equal to 1, you can see that 
        \(\sigma_1^2\) is greater, smaller, or equal to \(\sigma_2^2\). The reason for using the ratio of variances 
        instead of the difference of variances is that it is easy to find the sampling distribution of the 
        ratio of variances mathematically. If two populations follow normal distributions, and if \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) 
        samples are collected randomly from each population, the ratio of two sample variances \(S_1^2\) and \(S_2^2\) such as
      $$
        \frac{ \left( \frac{S_1^2}{\sigma_1^2} \right) } { \left( \frac{S_2^2}{\sigma_2^2} \right) }
      $$
        follows a \(F\)-distribution with the numerator degrees of freedom \(n_1 - 1\) and the 
        denominator degrees of freedom \(n_2 - 1\).  Using this fact, we can perform testing hypothesis 
        on the ratio of population variances. 
      <p>
        \(F\)-distribution is an asymmetrical distribution group with two parameters, the numerator 
        degrees of freedom and denominator degrees of freedom. &lt;Figure 8.2.1&gt; shows \(F\)-distributions 
        for different parameters.

        Hence the hypothesis \(\small H_0\) can not be rejected and conclude that two variances are equal.

      Consider the following examples which compare two population proportions.
      <p>
      <div class="textL30M10">
        -  Is there a gender gap in the approval rating for a particular candidate in this year's presidential election?

      <p>
        Comparing proportions \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) of two populations is possible by testing the difference
        between two proportions \(p_1 - p_2\) as the comparison of two population means. The difference 
        in sample proportions \({\hat p}_1 - {\hat p}_2\) from two populations follows a normal distribution
        with the mean \(p_1 - p_2\) and variance \(\frac{p_1 (1-p_1 )}{n_1} + \frac{p_2 (1-p_2 )}{n_2}\) 
        when two sample sizes are large enough. Since we do not know population proportions 
        \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) to estimate the variance, weighted average value \(\overline p\) 
        for two sample proportions  \({\hat p}_1 \) and \( {\hat p}_2\) by using sample sizes 
        as weights is used as follows:  
      <p>
      $$
         \overline p = \frac { n_1 {\hat p}_1 + n_2 {\hat p}_2 } {n_1 + n_2 }
      $$
        The testing hypothesis for two population proportions uses the following test statistic. 
      $$
        \frac { {\hat p}_1 - {\hat p}_2 } { \sqrt{ \frac{\overline p (1 - \overline p )}{n_1 } + \frac{\overline p (1 - \overline p ) }{n_2 }  } }

      <b>Example 8.3.1</b>
        A survey was conducted for a presidential election and samples were selected independently 
        from both male and female populations. 54 out of 225 samples from the male population 
        supported the candidate A and 52 out of 175 samples from the female population supported 
        the candidate A. Test whether there is a difference in approval ratings of the male and 
        female populations with the 5% significance level. Check the result using 『eStatU』.
      <p>
      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
      The hypothesis of this problem is \(\small  \; H_0 : p_1 = p_2 , H_1 : p_1 \ne p_2 \),  and its decision rule is as follows: 
      $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft '\text{If } \; | \frac { {\hat p}_1 - {\hat p}_2 } { \sqrt{ \frac{\overline p (1 - \overline p )}{n_1 } + \frac{\overline p (1 - \overline p ) }{n_2 }  } }  | > z_{&alpha;/2}, \text{ then reject } H_0 \;'
        \end{multline}
      $$
        Since \({\hat p}_1 = \frac{54}{225} \) = 0.240, \({\hat p}_2 = \frac{52}{175} = 0.297,\; \overline p  \) 
        and the test statistic can be calculated as follows: 
      $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft \overline p = \frac{54 + 52}{ 225 + 175} = \frac{106}{400} = 0.266 \\
        \shoveleft  | \frac { {\hat p}_1 - {\hat p}_2 } { \sqrt{ \frac{\overline p (1 - \overline p )}{n_1 } + \frac{\overline p (1 - \overline p ) }{n_2 }  } }  |  
           = | \frac { {0.240} - {0.297} } { \sqrt{ \frac{0.265(1 - 0.265)}{225} + \frac{0.265(1 - 0.265)}{175}  } }  | = 1.28\\
        \shoveleft z_{&alpha;/2} = z_{0.05/2} = z_{0.025} = 1.96 \\
        \end{multline}
      $$
        Therefore, the hypothesis \(\small H_0\) can not be rejected and we conclude that there is not enough 
        evidence that the approval ratings of male and female are different.

      In the year 2000, a simple random sampling of 1,000 people aged 15 to 29 across the country examined the status of marriage, and 63.5 percent were single. In the year 2020, another 1,000 people were surveyed independently, with 69.8 percent of them being single. From this fact, can you say that there has been a tendency to get married late in recent years? In other words, test at the 5% significance level whether the population aged 15 to 29 in 2020 is more likely to be single than in 2000. What is the p-value of this test?
      <p>
      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
      The hypothesis of this problem is \(\small  \; H_0 : p_1 = p_2 , \; H_1 : p_1 < p_2 \) ,  and its decision rule is as follows.
      $$ \small

        \shoveleft '\text{If } \frac { {\hat p}_1 - {\hat p}_2 } { \sqrt{ \frac{\overline p (1 - \overline p )}{n_1 } + \frac{\overline p (1 - \overline p ) }{n_2 }  } }  < - z_{&alpha;},  \text{ then reject } H_0 ' \\
        \end{multline}
      $$
        Since \({\hat p}_1 = 0.635 \) and \({\hat p}_2 = 0.698\), \(\overline p\) and the test statistic are as follows: 
      $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft \overline p = \frac{1000 \times 0.635 + 1000 \times 0.698}{1000 + 1000} = \frac{0.635 + 0.698}{2} = 0.667 \\
        \shoveleft \frac { {\hat p}_1 - {\hat p}_2 } { \sqrt{ \frac{\overline p (1 - \overline p )}{n_1 } + \frac{\overline p (1 - \overline p ) }{n_2 }  } }    
           =  \frac { {0.635} - {0.698} } { \sqrt{ \frac{0.667(1 - 0.667)}{1000} + \frac{0.667(1 - 0.667)}{1000}  } }  = -2.989\\
        \shoveleft - z_{&alpha;} = - z_{0.05} = -1.645 \\
        \end{multline}
      $$
      Therefore, \(\small H_0\) is rejected. and conclude that the proportion of unmarried people in 2020 
      has been increased. \(p\)-value can be calculated as follows: 
      $$ \small
        \begin{multline}
        \shoveleft p-\text{value} = P(Z \lt -2.989) = 0.0014 \\

    <div class="mainTable">
      In the previous two examples of comparing two population proportions, two sample proportions 
      were calculated from independent samples. 
      <p>
      Suppose two candidates ran in an election and one thousand samples were selected to test 
      whether there was any difference on the candidate's approval rating. The approval ratings 
      \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) of two candidates obtained from the sample are not independent, 
      because unlike two previous examples they are calculated from one set of samples. 
      So the test method should be different. The following statistic are used to test whether 
      there is a difference in approval ratings of two candidates.
      $$
        \frac{{\hat p}_1 - {\hat p}_2}{\sigma_{{\hat p}_1 - {\hat p}_2}},\quad 
        \text{ where } \sigma_{{\hat p}_1 - {\hat p}_2} = \sqrt{\frac{p_1 (1-p_1) + p_2 (1-p_2) +2p_1 p_2}{n}}
      $$
      Here, \(\sigma_{{\hat p}_1 - {\hat p}_2}\) is the standard error of \({\hat p}_1 - {\hat p}_2 \).
      <p>
      Assuming that two population proportions are equal, the estimated value \(\sigma_{{\hat p}_1 - {\hat p}_2}\) is as follows
      $$
        \sigma_{{\hat p}_1 - {\hat p}_2} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \overline p}{n}}, \text { where } \overline p = \frac{{\hat p}_1 + {\hat p}_2}{2} 
      $$
      If the sample size is large, the test statistic follows a normal distribution which allows 
      proper testing hypothesis according to the form of the alternative hypothesis. As such, 
      it is important to distinguish between sample proportions from independent samples and 
      not independent samples when we compare two population proportions.
